It's legal responsibility to make sure\r\n          the item is delivered to you. They should chase the delivery company\r\n          and let you know what's happened to your item. If your item wasn't\r\n          delivered to the location you agreed (e.g. if it was left with your\r\n          neighbour without your consent), it's the seller's legal\r\n          responsibility to sort out the issue.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          If the item doesn't turn up, you're legally entitled to a replacement\r\n          or refund. You can ask for your money back if you don't receive the\r\n          item within 30 days of buying it. If the seller refuses, you should\r\n          put your complaint in writing. If that doesn't work, you could contact\r\n          their trade association – look on their website for this information,\r\n          or contact them to ask.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          You might also be able to get your money back through your bank or\r\n          payment provider – this depends on how you paid.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <ul className=\"list-disc pl-8 mb-4\">\r\n          <li className=\"mb-2\">\r\n            If you paid by debit card, contact your bank and say you want to use\r\n            the 'chargeback' scheme. If the bank agrees, they can ask the\r\n            seller's bank to refund the money to your account. Many bank staff\r\n            don't know about the scheme, so you might need to speak to a\r\n            supervisor or manager.

It has a\r\n          separate glass lid, and the handle on the lid stays cool. It produces\r\n          perfectly cooked white rice, but tends to spit when cooking brown\r\n          rice. There are slight dirt traps around the rim of the lid, and\r\n          neither the pot nor the lid is dishwasher safe.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>B&nbsp;&nbsp; Family Rice Cooker</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          This has a plastic exterior and a flip-top lid. The lid locks when\r\n          closed and becomes a secure handle to carry the cooker. The aluminium\r\n          interior pot is quite difficult to clean, and it can't be put in a\r\n          dishwasher. It's programmed to adjust the temperature once the rice is\r\n          done so that it stops cooking but doesn't get cold.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>C&nbsp;&nbsp; Mini Rice Cooker</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          This has a flip-top lid and a 0.3 litre capacity. The interior pot is\r\n          made of non-stick aluminium and is dishwasher safe. This rice cooker\r\n          is ideal when cooking for one. However it does not have any handles at\r\n          the side, and water sometimes overflows when cooking brown rice.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>D&nbsp;&nbsp; VPN Rice Cooker</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          This has a painted steel exterior with a handle on each side and a\r\n          steel inner pot. It has a lift-off lid and comes with a booklet\r\n          including a range of ideas for rice dishes. However, the keep-warm\r\n          setting must be manually selected and the handles are tricky to grip.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>E&nbsp;&nbsp; S16 Rice cooker</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          This is simple to use, not spitting or boiling over even when cooking\r\n          brown rice. The exterior stays cool when in use, so there's no danger\r\n          of burning your hand. However, the lack of handles is a nuisance, and\r\n          a recipe book would have been useful.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h2 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4 mt-8\">SECTION 2</h2>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          <strong>Questions 15-27</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3 className=\"font-bold mb-2\">Safety when working on roofs</h3>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          A fall from height is the most serious hazard associated with roof\r\n          work. Preventing falls from roofs is a priority for{\" \"}\r\n          <em>WorkSafe New Zealand</em>. Investigation by <em>WorkSafe</em> into\r\n          falls that occur while working at height show that more than 50\r\n          percent of falls are from under three metres, and most of these are\r\n          from ladders and roofs. The cost of these falls is estimated to be $24\r\n          million a year – to say nothing of the human costs that result from\r\n          these falls. More injuries happen on residential building sites than\r\n          any other workplace in the construction sector.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          In order to prevent such injuries, a hazard assessment should be\r\n          carried out for all work on roofs to assess potential dangers. It is\r\n          essential that the hazards are identified before the work starts, and\r\n          that the necessary equipment, appropriate precautions and systems of\r\n          work are provided and implemented. Hazard identification should be\r\n          repeated periodically or when there is a change in conditions, for\r\n          example, the weather or numbers of staff onsite.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The first thing to be considered is whether it is possible to\r\n          eliminate this hazard completely, so that workers are not exposed to\r\n          the danger of falling. This can sometimes be done at the design,\r\n          construction planning, and tendering stage. If the possibility of a\r\n          fall cannot be eliminated, some form of edge protection should be used\r\n          to prevent workers from falling. It may be possible to use the\r\n          existing scaffolding as edge protection. If this is not practicable,\r\n          then temporary work platforms should be used. In cases where such\r\n          protection is not possible, then steps should be taken to minimise the\r\n          likelihood of any harm resulting. This means considering the use of\r\n          safety nets and other similar systems to make it less likely that\r\n          injury will be caused if a fall does occur.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Ladders should only be employed for short-duration maintenance work\r\n          such as touching up paint. People using ladders should be trained and\r\n          instructed in the selection and safe use of ladders. There should be\r\n          inspection of all ladders on a regular basis to ensure they are safe\r\n          to use.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3 className=\"font-bold mb-2 mt-8\">\r\n          Maternity Allowance for working women\r\n        </h3>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          You can claim Maternity Allowance once you've been pregnant for 26\r\n          weeks.

At the\r\n          time, Marshall was working to build a water-powered sawmill for\r\n          businessman John Sutter. As it happens, just days after Marshall's\r\n          discovery, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed, ending the\r\n          Mexican-American War and transferring California, with its mineral\r\n          deposits, into the ownership of the United States. At the time, the\r\n          population of the territory consisted of 6,500 Californios (people of\r\n          Spanish or Mexican descent); 700 foreigners (primarily Americans); and\r\n          150,000 Native Americans.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>B</strong>\r\n          <br />\r\n          Though Marshall and Sutter tried to keep news of the discovery quiet,\r\n          word got out, and by mid-March 1848 at least one newspaper was\r\n          reporting that large quantities of gold were being found. Though the\r\n          initial reaction in San Francisco was disbelief, storekeeper Sam\r\n          Brannan set off a frenzy when he paraded through town displaying a\r\n          small bottle containing gold from Sutter's Creek. By mid-June, some\r\n          three-quarters of the male population of San Francisco had left town\r\n          for the gold mines, and the number of miners in the area reached 4,000\r\n          by August.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>C</strong>\r\n          <br />\r\n          As news spread of the fortunes being made in California, the first\r\n          migrants to arrive were those from lands accessible by boat, such as\r\n          Oregon, the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii), Mexico, Chile, Peru and\r\n          even China. Only later would the news reach the East Coast, where\r\n          press reports were initially skeptical. Throughout 1849, thousands of\r\n          people around the United States (mostly men) borrowed money, mortgaged\r\n          their property or spent their life savings to make the arduous journey\r\n          to California. In pursuit of the kind of wealth they had never dreamed\r\n          of, they left their families and local areas; in turn, their wives had\r\n          no option but to shoulder different responsibilities such as running\r\n          farms or businesses, and many made a real success of them.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          By the end of the year, the non-native population of California was\r\n          estimated at 100,000 (as compared with 20,000 at the end of 1848 and\r\n          around 800 in March 1848). To accommodate the needs of the '49ers, as\r\n          the gold miners were known, towns had sprung up all over the region,\r\n          complete with shops and other businesses seeking to make their own\r\n          Gold Rush fortune. The overcrowded chaos of the mining camps and towns\r\n          grew ever more lawless. San Francisco, for its part, developed a\r\n          bustling economy and became the central metropolis of the new\r\n          frontier.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>D</strong>\r\n          <br />\r\n          How did all these would-be miners search for gold? Panning was the\r\n          oldest way. The basic procedure was to place some gold-bearing\r\n          material, such as river gravel, into a shallow pan, add some water,\r\n          and then carefully swirl the mixture around so the water and light\r\n          material spilled over the side. If all went well, the heavier gold\r\n          nuggets or gold dust would settle to the bottom of the pan. Gold\r\n          panning was slow even for the most skillful miner. On a good day, one\r\n          miner could wash about 50 pans in the usual 12-hour workday.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>E</strong>\r\n          <br />\r\n          Another way was to use what was called a 'rocker'. Isaac Humphrey is\r\n          said to have introduced it to the California gold fields. It was\r\n          simply a rectangular wooden box, set at a downward angle and mounted\r\n          on a rocking mechanism. The dirt and rock was dumped into the top,\r\n          followed by a bucket of water. The box was rocked by hand to agitate\r\n          the mixture. The big rocks were caught in a sieve at the top, the\r\n          waste exited the lower and with the water, and the heavy gold fell to\r\n          the bottom of the box.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The rocker had advantages and disadvantages. The advantages were that\r\n          it was easily transportable; it did not require a constant source of\r\n          water; and, most importantly, a miner could process more dirt and rock\r\n          than with a pan. The primary disadvantage was that the rocker had\r\n          difficulty in trapping the smallest particles of gold, commonly known\r\n          as 'flour'. Some miners added small amounts of mercury to the bottom\r\n          of the rocker. Due to its chemical composition, it had a facility to\r\n          trap fine gold. Periodically, the miners would remove and heat it. As\r\n          it vaporized, it would leave gold behind.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>F</strong>\r\n          <br />\r\n          After 1850, the surface gold in California had largely disappeared,\r\n          even as miners continued to reach the gold fields. Mining had always\r\n          been difficult and dangerous labor, and striking it rich required good\r\n          luck as much as skill and hard work. Moreover, the average daily pay\r\n          for an independent miner had by then dropped sharply from what it had\r\n          been in 1848. As gold became more and more difficult to reach, the\r\n          growing industrialization of mining drove more and more miners from\r\n          independence into wage labor. The new technique of hydraulic mining,\r\n          developed in 1853, brought enormous profits, but destroyed much of the\r\n          region's landscape.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>G</strong>\r\n          <br />\r\n          Though gold mining continued throughout the 1850s, it had reached its\r\n          peak by 1852, when gold worth some 81 million dollars was pulled from\r\n          the ground.

hoping it might contain gold. Small amounts were put in\r\n              a pan with water. The pan was spun round, causing the liquid and\r\n              less heavy contents of the pan to come out. Gold dust, which\r\n              weighed more, remained in the pan or, if the miners were very\r\n              lucky, there might even be some <strong>38</strong>{\" \"}\r\n              <Input type=\"text\" className=\"w-32 mx-1 inline-block\" /> too. It\r\n              was, however, a very laborious method.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n              The rocker was also used. A miner would put some earth and rock\r\n              into the higher end, together with some water. He would then shake\r\n              the rocker. Larger stones stuck in the <strong>39</strong>{\" \"}\r\n              <Input type=\"text\" className=\"w-32 mx-1 inline-block\" />, while\r\n              gold dropped to the bottom. Unfortunately, the rocker was not\r\n              designed to catch what was called flour. However, a process was\r\n              introduced involving <strong>40</strong>{\" \"}\r\n              <Input type=\"text\" className=\"w-32 mx-1 inline-block\" /> to ensure\r\n              no gold was washed out in the water.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>",
