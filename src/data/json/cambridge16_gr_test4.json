Hanwag Tatra Boots</strong>\r\n          <br />\r\n          These boots are expensive but will give you a lifetime of wear. They\r\n          are a wide fit and offer excellent ankle support. They passed our\r\n          waterproof test when worn on long, rainy walks, although they are a\r\n          bit heavy.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>B. Scarpa Peak Gore-tex Boots</strong>\r\n          <br />\r\n          These are good all-round boots that have kept our feet dry in heavy\r\n          rain, snow and mud. They are comfortable from the moment you put them\r\n          on, with no rubbing. They come up higher than some other boots,\r\n          offering good ankle support, and fit both narrow and wide feet well.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>C. Berghaus Explorer Trek Boots</strong>\r\n          <br />\r\n          Our tester took these boots straight out of the box, put them on and\r\n          did a 20-kilometre walk with no problems at all. They're nice and\r\n          light, but still supportive and completely waterproof. The grip was\r\n          good on both wet and dry surfaces. We only tested them in spring and\r\n          summer, though, so we can't say how warm they'd be in winter.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>D. Salomon X Ultra Mid GTX Boots</strong>\r\n          <br />\r\n          These boots feel like comfortable trainers that hold your feet well.\r\n          With good grip and made of material that allows air in, they're great\r\n          when the weather is warm. But when we walked through a stream, a tiny\r\n          amount of water did get in. This wasn't a big problem, though, and\r\n          they dried out quickly afterwards.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>E. The North Face Hedgehog Trek GTX Boots</strong>\r\n          <br />\r\n          Our tester has had difficulty getting boots that fit her narrow feet\r\n          but found these comfortable and supportive. They kept her feet dry in\r\n          wet conditions, but they don't come up as high as some other boots,\r\n          and so they might be best suited for summer walking.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>F. Merrell Moab FST Ice+ Thermo Boots</strong>\r\n          <br />\r\n          These boots were especially designed for winter and they certainly\r\n          kept our feet warm and dry. They were good on frozen ground and snow,\r\n          though on steep, slippery surfaces they were not quite as effective.\r\n          Our tester, who walks a lot, felt they would probably not last as long\r\n          as she would like.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>G. Aku Tribute II GTX Boots</strong>\r\n          <br />\r\n          Our tester found these boots really comfortable and fully waterproof\r\n          in all weathers, with very good ankle support. They also coped well\r\n          with steep, rough ground. But although they claim to be suitable for\r\n          people with wider feet, he felt they were average width at best, and\r\n          they took a while to soften up and become more flexible.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold my-4\">How to choose hiking boots</h4>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          When buying boots, comfort is the top priority. If they don't feel\r\n          good in the shop, don't buy them. Your toes need room to move, but\r\n          your feet shouldn't slide around. Choose a bad weather day to go\r\n          shopping and wear the socks you'd usually wear when hiking. Ask to try\r\n          the boots on a slope to check whether your feet slide forwards.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Most boots need breaking in, which you should do by wearing them round\r\n          the house for a couple of days, or on short walks to begin with. Over\r\n          time, they will become more flexible.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Consider the surfaces you'll be walking on. For hikes on\r\n          well-maintained paths and in warm weather, fabric boots will probably\r\n          do, but in more challenging conditions, including steep, wet or snowy\r\n          slopes, you'll want sturdier boots, with soles that provide excellent\r\n          grip.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Good ankle support is important for rocky terrain, as there's a risk\r\n          of twisting an ankle, especially on descents. Also essential in wet\r\n          areas is waterproofing. Gore-Tex boots are popular because they keep\r\n          out rain but allow air to pass through, which helps keep feet cool in\r\n          summer.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Leather boots are good for winter, and although they're more\r\n          expensive, they'll last longer than some of the cheaper fabric boots\r\n          if you look after them. After a wet walk, take out the inner soles to\r\n          dry to help prevent bad smells, and consider buying a special cleaner\r\n          to remove mud. Also, you might need to apply waterproofing cream from\r\n          time to time.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          But whichever boots you choose, they'll become like good friends:\r\n          comfortable and dependable.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      {/* READING PASSAGE 2 */}\r\n      <div className=\"mb-8\">\r\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4\">SECTION 2: Questions 15-27</h3>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 15-27</strong>,\r\n          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-2\">The History of Laundering</h4>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Throughout history, people have gone to great lengths to ensure they\r\n          have clean clothes. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that an\r\n          understanding of the materials used to make fabrics and the methods\r\n          used to wash them is to track the progress of scientific thinking and\r\n          social development.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>A)</strong> The earliest washing 'technology' would have\r\n          involved nothing more than people pounding clothes on rocks by rivers\r\n          or streams. Right up to the late 19th century, laundering was for many\r\n          people still a matter of taking clothes to rivers and pounding them on\r\n          rocks, although perhaps with the help of boards for scrubbing.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>B)</strong> The earliest synthetic soaps are thought to have\r\n          originated in ancient Babylon around 4,000 years ago. Archaeologists\r\n          once found a kind of soap in clay cylinders, the remains of which\r\n          suggested they contained a form of soap-like material. Inscriptions on\r\n          the cylinders mentioned they were used for the washing of clothes.\r\n          Soap manufacture was established in most countries in the western\r\n          world by the 7th century CE. Companies often used vegetable oils and\r\n          animal fats as ingredients. Soap-making was a relatively simple\r\n          process â€“ at its most basic, it involved mixing fats with an alkaline\r\n          substance such as wood ash, which contains potassium carbonate.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>C)</strong> The Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th\r\n          centuries brought changes to soap production, including the\r\n          development of continuous processing methods. This helped to increase\r\n          the range of soap products available. In Britain, Andrew Pears created\r\n          and patented the first transparent soap in 1789. It was considered a\r\n          luxury item and Pears remained the brand of choice for many British\r\n          households into the 20th century.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>D)</strong> In Britain, washing clothes was traditionally a\r\n          woman's job, and it involved hard labour. She would be up at 5am to\r\n          lay the fire, put water in the copper vessel for the hot water and get\r\n          the dollies and line ready. 'Dollies' were wooden items that were used\r\n          to push the clothes against the sides of the copper vessel. A big wash\r\n          could take all day. Part of the job was to pass the wet items through\r\n          a mangle, a machine formed by two rotating rollers that pressed the\r\n          water from the clothes. This was one of the most dangerous jobs, since\r\n          women did occasionally get their fingers and hair caught in the\r\n          mechanism.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>E)</strong> The box mangle of the 18th and 19th centuries was\r\n          a very different mechanism. It was more like a press than a roller.\r\n          Wet clothes would be laid on a cloth that was wrapped around a\r\n          cylinder under a rectangular box that contained heavy stones â€“ often\r\n          weighing between 15 and 30 kilos. The cylinder would be moved back and\r\n          forth to press the moisture out of the clothes. The box mangle was a\r\n          common sight in many middle-class houses as it helped to create a\r\n          smoother appearance after the drying process was complete.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>F)</strong> Currently, researchers are attempting to design\r\n          energy-efficient washing machines that optimise detergent performance\r\n          to bring about effective wash cleaning at low wash temperatures. At\r\n          the forefront of this research in the UK is the Institute of\r\n          Mechanical Engineers at Leeds University, which has been engaged in\r\n          work on laundry cleaning for over 40 years. Their current research is\r\n          aimed at helping to make washing machines more sustainable. Within the\r\n          laboratory, engineers test the performance of detergents as well as\r\n          undertaking mechanical and electronic testing.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>G)</strong> Although thermometers were available for measuring\r\n          wash bath temperature from the 17th century, there was no means of\r\n          accurately controlling the temperature. It remained under manual\r\n          control in most commercial laundries until the 1950s. The advent of\r\n          electronic controls has brought about many improvements. Today,\r\n          washing machines have features like load-detection, whereby\r\n          information from sensors is used to determine the best wash cycle.\r\n          This optimises the amount of water used and the wash program, thus\r\n          adjusting the wash time according to the fabric and the load. You can\r\n          now also buy a washing machine that uses fuzzy logic, which is a\r\n          mathematical system where, instead of simply being on or off (binary),\r\n          something can be partially on. So where a normal machine may have\r\n          simply detected that the load is 5 kilos and so performed a preset 5\r\n          kilo cycle, the fuzzy logic machine will determine the load to some\r\n          level of precision and create what could be called a unique cycle,\r\n          just for that load. This gives a better wash and uses less water and\r\n          less electricity.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>H)</strong> In 2000, a government report was produced,\r\n          highlighting how laundering could contribute to climate change. It\r\n          suggested that to minimise damage to our environment we should wash\r\n          our clothes at lower temperatures.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>I)</strong> Despite all the advantages of improved clothing\r\n          care, there is considerable concern today that modern washing machines\r\n          could be having a detrimental impact on our natural environment. Most\r\n          clothing contains some plastic; for example, polyester, nylon and\r\n          acrylic, making up 60% of our garments. Every time we put them in a\r\n          washing machine, microfibers of plastic break off. Microfibers are so\r\n          small that they drain out of our washing machines and can easily pass\r\n          through sewage treatment plants. They flow directly into our rivers,\r\n          lakes and oceans, and have even reached the North and South Poles.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>J)</strong> Microfibers are tiny but they can cause huge\r\n          damage. Studies have indicated that these fibers are found in food and\r\n          air, too. Scientists are studying them but still haven't found a way\r\n          to completely stop them. In the meantime, a group of teachers and\r\n          students from a London school has invented the Microfibre Catcher.\r\n          It's a small device that fits inside a washing machine and catches\r\n          over a third of the microfibers that would otherwise enter the water\r\n          system. Alternatively, you can use a special bag that has been shown\r\n          to catch up to 90-99% of the microfibers released during washing.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      {/* READING PASSAGE 3 */}\r\n      <div className=\"mb-8\">\r\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4\">SECTION 3: Questions 28-40</h3>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 28-40</strong>,\r\n          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-2\">Trade across the Sahara Desert</h4>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          For almost 1,000 years, trade caravans regularly crossed the Sahara\r\n          Desert. African gold, salt, textiles, leather goods, and enslaved\r\n          people went north, while in the opposite direction flowed the\r\n          textiles, ceramics, glassware, and manufactured luxuries of North\r\n          Africa, Europe, and Asia. Throughout this period, the gold of West\r\n          Africa was especially significant in this trade. Although the Sahara\r\n          is often regarded as a barrier, trade routes across this desert\r\n          connected sub-Saharan Africa to the rest of the Mediterranean and\r\n          Middle Eastern worlds in a complex commercial network.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          It is important to understand that there were several factors that\r\n          made trans-Saharan travel difficult. For example, the sheer scale of\r\n          the Sahara was a major problem. For travellers on foot or horseback,\r\n          distances were almost impossible to navigate. The heat during the day\r\n          could be intolerable, and at night temperatures could drop below\r\n          freezing. The sandstorms of this region are legendary. In such storms,\r\n          the winds can reach hurricane force and sand is stirred up so\r\n          violently that people can become completely disoriented and visibility\r\n          is severely reduced. Furthermore, much of the Sahara is not covered\r\n          with sand but has a surface of gravel, and a rocky terrain that\r\n          creates further obstacles. Another significant issue is that the\r\n          Sahara is mostly a waterless region. What little water is available is\r\n          to be found in oases - settlements built around isolated sources of\r\n          water from underground rivers or springs.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          So how was trade carried out across the hostile environment of the\r\n          Sahara? A major factor was the introduction of the camel as a beast of\r\n          burden. Camels had always been present in parts of the Sahara, but\r\n          were not used as domestic animals until around 300 CE, following the\r\n          collapse of the Roman Empire. By the 8th century CE, however, they had\r\n          acquired an important role in the growing trade across the desert. The\r\n          domesticated camel can carry 150-200 kilograms and go for up to ten\r\n          days without water. Its padded feet are well suited for walking on\r\n          sand and its size allows it to cope with sandstorms better than\r\n          horses. In addition, camels can be milked and, when they are too old\r\n          to carry loads, they can be killed and their meat used for food. Two\r\n          varieties of camel were used by caravans: one heavier beast was used\r\n          on flatter terrain, and a lighter, more nimble variety was used on\r\n          rockier ground.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Caravans were made up of a number of camels - occasionally over a\r\n          thousand - and were often put together by several merchants who then\r\n          appointed a leader for the whole party. Although there were a number\r\n          of trans-Saharan routes, the typical caravan did not travel directly\r\n          across the middle of the desert. Instead it followed a route from\r\n          oasis to oasis, often determinedly keeping to valleys and depressions\r\n          in the landscape. The leader, or caravaneer, needed a detailed\r\n          knowledge of the route, including water sources. If the caravan had a\r\n          military escort, the commander would often act on the caravaneer's\r\n          advice about routes and about how to behave if they encountered local\r\n          tribesmen. The typical Saharan caravan moved slowly, covering about\r\n          three kilometers in an hour. Such caravans usually travelled for about\r\n          ten hours daily, making the day's journey around 30 kilometers, after\r\n          which the merchants, their trade goods and the camels stopped for the\r\n          night.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          There were a number of trading centres along the trans-Saharan route.\r\n          On the northern fringes of the Sahara, Sijilmasa and Tunis were\r\n          crucial for the routes heading north. These cities were important\r\n          because merchants from the Middle East would meet with European\r\n          commercial agents there as well as those bringing goods from south of\r\n          the Sahara. In the south, Timbuktu in modern Mali became a critical\r\n          point for trade from the sub-Saharan region. Located on the Niger\r\n          River and founded in around 1100 CE, Timbuktu was a major trading\r\n          center for salt, gold and other goods until well into the 19th\r\n          century, and was also a great center of Islamic learning.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          A major commodity that was traded northwards was gold. Gold mined in\r\n          West Africa was an important trading item and was also used as a\r\n          convenient way of storing wealth. It was crucially important as a\r\n          medium of exchange in the financial systems of North Africa and the\r\n          Middle East, which were integrated into the economies of Europe and\r\n          Asia. Salt, which was very valuable in the sub-Saharan economies, was\r\n          shipped in large quantities to the south. The salt mines near the\r\n          oasis of Taghaza produced more than 5,000 tons of salt every year in\r\n          the 16th century. Animal skins and crafted leather were also important\r\n          items in the caravans, while manufactured goods, such as ceramics,\r\n          glassware and beads, were carried southwards.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Enslaved Africans were also brought north from the sub-Saharan region.\r\n          Indeed, the word 'slave' derives from the medieval Latin word for\r\n          'Slav' because in the early Middle Ages, many enslaved people were\r\n          ethnic Slavs from Eastern and Central Europe. As the supply of\r\n          European slaves declined in the 10th century, people from sub-Saharan\r\n          Africa were enslaved to meet the labour needs in Europe as well as in\r\n          the Middle East.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The trans-Saharan trade showed signs of change from the 15th century.\r\n          The decline was related to several factors. First, European\r\n          entrepreneurs were developing an oceanic route from Europe to West\r\n          Africa. The Portuguese led the way in the second half of the 15th\r\n          century and trading posts were established along the coast of West\r\n          Africa in the 16th and 17th centuries. These provided European\r\n          merchants with direct access to the gold of West Africa and other\r\n          goods. Second, the political stability of the trans-Saharan routes was\r\n          also changing. The Songhai Empire dominated the area between the Niger\r\n          River and the Sahara for much of the 15th and 16th centuries, and was\r\n          a major force in ensuring the safety of trade routes. In 1591, an\r\n          invading army from Morocco defeated the Songhai, and this had a\r\n          negative impact on long-distance trade. However, reports of the\r\n          trans-Saharan trade's decline shouldn't be exaggerated. In the 19th\r\n          century, long-distance caravans still headed from the southern Sahara\r\n          regions northwards to places like Cairo, and trans-Saharan trade still\r\n          exists today, albeit in a much reduced form.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>",
