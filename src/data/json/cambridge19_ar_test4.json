If\r\n          this trend continues, it might have unpredictable knock-on effects for\r\n          other species in the ecosystem. Butterfly eggs develop into\r\n          caterpillars and these insects, which are the second stage in a new\r\n          butterfly's lifecycle, consume vast quantities of plant material, and\r\n          in turn act as prey for birds as well as bats and other small mammals.\r\n          Only by arming themselves with an understanding of why butterfly\r\n          numbers are down can conservationists hope to halt or reverse the\r\n          decline.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          Butterflies prefer outdoor conditions to be 'just right', which means\r\n          neither too hot nor too cold. Under the conditions of climate change,\r\n          the temperature at any given time in summer is generally getting\r\n          warmer, leaving butterflies with the challenge of how to deal with\r\n          this. One of the main ways in which species are ensuring conditions\r\n          suit them is by changing the time of year at which they are active and\r\n          reproduce. Scientists refer to the timing of such lifecycle events as\r\n          'phenology', so when an animal or plant starts to do something earlier\r\n          in the year than it usually does, it is said to be 'advancing its\r\n          phenology'.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          These advances have been observed already in a wide range of\r\n          butterflies – indeed, most species are advancing their phenology to\r\n          some extent. In Britain, as the average spring temperature has\r\n          increased by roughly 0.5°C over the past 20 years, species have\r\n          advanced by between three days and a week on average, to keep in line\r\n          with cooler temperatures. Is this a sign that butterflies are well\r\n          equipped to cope with climate change, and readily adjust to new\r\n          temperatures? Or are these populations under stress, being dragged\r\n          along unwillingly by unnaturally fast changes? The answer is still\r\n          unknown, but a new study is seeking to answer these questions.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          First, the researchers pulled together data from millions of records\r\n          that had been submitted by butterfly enthusiasts – people who spend\r\n          their free time observing the activities of different species. This\r\n          provided information on 130 species of butterflies in Great Britain\r\n          every year for a 20-year period. They then estimated the abundance and\r\n          distribution of each species across this time, along with how far\r\n          north in the country they had moved. The data also, crucially, allowed\r\n          researchers to estimate subtle changes in what time of the year each\r\n          species was changing into an adult butterfly.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          Analysing the trends in each variable, the researchers discovered that\r\n          species with more flexible lifecycles were more likely to be able to\r\n          benefit from an earlier emergence driven by climate change. Some\r\n          species are able to go from caterpillar to butterfly twice or more per\r\n          year, so that the individual butterflies you see flying in the spring\r\n          are the grandchildren or great-grandchildren of the individuals seen a\r\n          year previously.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          Among these species, researchers observed that those which have been\r\n          advancing their phenology the most over the 20-year study period also\r\n          had the most positive trends in abundance, distribution and northwards\r\n          extent. For these species, such as Britain's tiniest butterfly, the\r\n          dainty Small Blue, whose colonies are up to a hundred strong, some\r\n          develop into butterflies early in spring, allowing their summer\r\n          generations to complete another reproductive cycle by autumn so that\r\n          more population growth occurs.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          Other species, however, are less flexible and restricted to a single\r\n          reproductive cycle per year. For these species, there was no evidence\r\n          of any benefit to emerging earlier. Indeed, worryingly, it was found\r\n          that the species in this group that specialise in very specific\r\n          habitat types, often related to the caterpillar's preferred diet,\r\n          actually tended to be most at harm from advancing phenology. The\r\n          beautiful High Brown Fritillary, often described as Britain's most\r\n          endangered butterfly, is in this group. It is found only in coppiced\r\n          woodland and limestone pavement habitats. It is also a\r\n          single-generation butterfly that has advanced its phenology. This\r\n          suggests that climate change, while undoubtedly not the sole cause,\r\n          might have played a part in the downfall of this species.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          All is not lost, however. Many of Britain's single-generation species\r\n          show the capacity, in continental Europe, to add a second generation\r\n          in years that are sufficiently warm. Therefore, as the climate\r\n          continues to warm, species like the Silver-studded Blue might be able\r\n          to switch to multiple generations in the UK as well, and so begin to\r\n          extract benefits from the additional warmth, potentially leading to\r\n          population increases.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          More immediately, conservationists can arm themselves with all this\r\n          knowledge to spot the warning signs of species that may be at risk.\r\n          The White Admiral of southern England, a much sought-after butterfly,\r\n          experienced a significant increase in numbers from the 1920s but has\r\n          shown a considerable decline in the past 20 years. This may be because\r\n          the caterpillar exists solely on a diet of a plant called honeysuckle.\r\n          But it is also likely to be due to climate change.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"reading-passage p-4 bg-white mb-4\">\r\n        <h2 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4\">READING PASSAGE 2</h2>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based\r\n          on Reading Passage 2.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-center\">Deep-sea mining</h3>\r\n        <p className=\"italic text-center mb-4\">\r\n          Bacteria from the ocean floor can beat superbugs and cancer. But\r\n          habitats are at risk from the hunger for marine minerals\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          <strong>A</strong> When Professor Mat Upton found that a microbe from\r\n          a deep-sea sponge was killing pathogenic bugs in his laboratory, he\r\n          realised it could be a breakthrough in the fight against\r\n          antibiotic-resistant superbugs, which are responsible for thousands of\r\n          deaths a year in the UK alone. Further tests confirmed that an\r\n          antibiotic from the sponge bacteria, found living more than 700 metres\r\n          under the sea at the Rockall trough in the north-east Atlantic, was\r\n          previously unknown to science, boosting its potential as a life-saving\r\n          medicine. But Upton, and other scientists who view the deep ocean and\r\n          its wealth of unique and undocumented species as a prospecting ground\r\n          for new medicines, fear such potential will be lost in the rush to\r\n          exploit the deep sea's equally rich metal and mineral resources.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          <strong>B</strong> 'We're looking at the bioactive potential of marine\r\n          resources, to see if there are any more medicines or drugs down there\r\n          before we destroy it for ever,' says Upton, a medical microbiologist\r\n          at the University of Plymouth. He is among many scientists urging a\r\n          halt to deep-sea mining, asking for time to weigh up the pros and\r\n          cons. 'In sustainability terms, this could be a better way of\r\n          exploiting the economic potential of the deep sea,' he argues.\r\n          Oceanographers using remotely operated vehicles have spotted many new\r\n          species. Among them have been sea cucumbers with tails allowing them\r\n          to sail along the ocean floor, and a rare 'Dumbo' octopus, found 3,000\r\n          metres under the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of California. Any one\r\n          of these could offer lifesaving potential. Upton estimates it could\r\n          take up to a decade for a newly discovered antibiotic to become a\r\n          medicine – but the race towards commercial mining in the ocean abyss\r\n          has already begun.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          <strong>C</strong> The deep sea contains more nickel, cobalt and rare\r\n          earth metals than all land reserves combined, according to the US\r\n          Geological Survey. Mining corporations argue that deepsea exploration\r\n          could help diversify the supply of metals and point to the fact that\r\n          demand for resources such as copper, aluminium, cobalt for electric\r\n          car batteries and other metals to power technology and smartphones, is\r\n          soaring. They say that deep-sea mining could yield far superior ore to\r\n          land mining with little, if any, waste. Different methods of\r\n          extraction exist, but most involve employing some form of converted\r\n          machinery previously used in terrestrial mining to excavate materials\r\n          from the sea floor, at depths of up to 6,000 metres, then drawing a\r\n          seawater slurry, containing rock and other solid particles, from the\r\n          sea floor to ships on the surface. The slurry is then 'de-watered' and\r\n          transferred to another vessel for shipping. Extracted seawater is\r\n          pumped back down and discharged close to the sea floor.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          <strong>D</strong> But environmental and legal groups have urged\r\n          caution, arguing there are potentially massive and unknown\r\n          ramifications for the environment and for nearby communities, and that\r\n          the global regulatory framework is not yet drafted. 'Despite arising\r\n          in the last half century, the \"new global gold rush\" of deep-sea\r\n          mining shares many features with past resource scrambles – including a\r\n          general disregard for environmental and social impacts, and the\r\n          marginalisation of indigenous peoples and their rights,' a paper,\r\n          written by Julie Hunter and Julian Aguon, from Blue Ocean Law, and\r\n          Pradeep Singh, from the Center for Marine Environmental Sciences,\r\n          Bremen, argues. The authors say that knowledge of the deep seabed\r\n          remains extremely limited. 'The surface of the Moon, Mars and even\r\n          Venus have all been mapped and studied in much greater detail, leading\r\n          marine scientists to commonly remark that, with respect to the deep\r\n          sea, \"We don't yet know what we need to know\".'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          <strong>E</strong> Scientific research – including a recent paper in\r\n          Marine Policy journal – has suggested the deep seabed, and\r\n          hydrothermal vents, which are created when seawater meets volcanic\r\n          magma, have crucial impacts upon biodiversity and the global climate.\r\n          The mineral-rich vents and their surrounds are also home to many\r\n          well-known animals including crustaceans, tubeworms, clams, slugs,\r\n          anemones and fish. 'It is becoming increasingly clear that deepsea\r\n          mining poses a grave threat to these vital seabed functions,' the\r\n          paper says. 'Extraction methods would produce large sediment plumes\r\n          and involve the discharge of waste back into the ocean, significantly\r\n          disturbing seafloor environments,' the paper continues. 'On deep sea\r\n          vents, scientists are clear,' says Dr Jon Copley of the National\r\n          Oceanography Centre, Southampton: 'we don't want mining on them.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          <strong>F</strong> The oceans occupy around 70% of the planet and are\r\n          relatively unexplored, says Mike Johnston, chief executive of\r\n          Nautilus, a Canadian underwater exploration company: 'It makes sense\r\n          to explore this untapped potential in an environmentally sustainable\r\n          way, instead of continually looking at the fast depleting land\r\n          resources of the planet to meet society's rising needs.' Those leading\r\n          the global rush to place giant mining machines thousands of metres\r\n          below the sea surface say the environmental impacts will be far lower\r\n          than on land. But critics say exotic and little-known ecosystems in\r\n          the deep oceans could be destroyed and must be protected. 'Mining will\r\n          be the greatest assault on deep-sea ecosystems ever inflicted by\r\n          humans,' according to hydrothermal vent expert Verena Tunnicliffe, at\r\n          the University of Victoria in Canada. She argues that active vents\r\n          must be off-limits for mining to protect the new knowledge and\r\n          biotechnology spin-offs they can deliver, and that strict controls\r\n          must be in place elsewhere.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"reading-passage p-4 bg-white mb-4\">\r\n        <h2 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4\">READING PASSAGE 3</h2>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based\r\n          on Reading Passage 3 below.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-center\">\r\n          The Unselfish Gene\r\n        </h3>\r\n        <p className=\"italic text-center mb-4\">\r\n          A psychologist gives his view on how humans became self-centred\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          There has long been a general assumption that human beings are\r\n          essentially selfish. We're apparently ruthless, with strong impulses\r\n          to compete against each other for resources and to accumulate power\r\n          and possessions. If we are kind to one another, it's usually because\r\n          we have ulterior motives. If we are good, it's only because we have\r\n          managed to control and transcend our innate selfishness and brutality.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          This bleak view of human nature is closely associated with the science\r\n          writer Richard Dawkins, whose 1976 book The Selfish Gene became\r\n          popular because it fitted so well with – and helped to justify – the\r\n          competitive and individualistic ethos that was so prevalent in late\r\n          20th-century societies. Like many others, Dawkins justifies his views\r\n          with reference to the field of evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary\r\n          psychology theorises that present-day human traits developed in\r\n          prehistoric times, during what is termed the 'environment of\r\n          evolutionary adaptedness'.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          Prehistory is usually seen as a period of intense competition, when\r\n          life was such a brutal battle that only those with traits such as\r\n          selfishness, aggression and ruthlessness survived. And because\r\n          survival depended on access to resources – such as rivers, forests and\r\n          animals – there was bound to be conflict between rival groups, which\r\n          led to the development of traits such as racism and warfare. This\r\n          seems logical. But, in fact, the assumption on which this all rests –\r\n          that prehistoric life was a desperate struggle for survival – is\r\n          false.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          It's important to remember that in the prehistoric era, the world was\r\n          very sparsely populated. According to some estimates, around 15,000\r\n          years ago, the population of Europe was only 29,000, and the\r\n          population of the whole world was less than half a million. Humans at\r\n          that time were hunter-gatherers: people who lived by hunting wild\r\n          animals and collecting wild plants. With such small population\r\n          densities, it seems unlikely that prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups\r\n          had to compete against each other for resources or had any need to\r\n          develop ruthlessness and competitiveness, or to go to war.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          There is significant evidence to back this notion from contemporary\r\n          hunter-gatherer groups, who live in the same way as prehistoric humans\r\n          did. As the anthropologist Bruce Knauft has remarked, hunter-gatherers\r\n          are characterised by 'extreme political and sexual egalitarianism'.\r\n          Knauft has observed that individuals in such groups don't accumulate\r\n          property or possessions and have an ethical obligation to share\r\n          everything. They also have methods of preserving egalitarianism by\r\n          ensuring that disparities of status don't arise.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          The !Kung people of southern Africa, for example, swap arrows before\r\n          going hunting and when an animal is killed, the acclaim does not go to\r\n          the person who fired the arrow, but to the person the arrow belongs\r\n          to. And if a person becomes too domineering, the other members of the\r\n          group ostracise them, exiling the offender from society. Typically in\r\n          such groups, men do not dictate what women do. Women in\r\n          hunter-gatherer groups worldwide often benefit from a high level of\r\n          autonomy, being able to select their own marriage partners, decide\r\n          what work they do and work whenever they choose to. And if a marriage\r\n          breaks down, they have custody rights over their children.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          Many anthropologists believe that societies such as the !Kung were\r\n          normal until a few thousand years ago, when population growth led to\r\n          the development of agriculture and a settled lifestyle. In view of the\r\n          above, there seems little reason to assume that traits such as racism,\r\n          warfare and male domination should have been selected by evolution as\r\n          they would have been of little benefit in the prehistoric era.\r\n          Individuals who behaved selfishly and ruthlessly would be less likely\r\n          to survive, since they would have been ostracised from their groups.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          It makes more sense, then, to see traits such as cooperation,\r\n          egalitarianism, altruism and peacefulness as innate characteristics of\r\n          human beings. These were the traits that were prevalent in human life\r\n          for tens of thousands of years. So presumably these traits are still\r\n          strong in us now.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          But if prehistoric life wasn't really as brutal as has often been\r\n          assumed, why do modern humans behave so selfishly and ruthlessly?\r\n          Perhaps these negative traits should be seen as a later development,\r\n          the result of environmental and psychological factors. Research has\r\n          shown repeatedly that when the natural habitats of primates such as\r\n          apes and gorillas are disrupted, they tend to become more violent and\r\n          hierarchical.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          So, it could well be that the same thing has happened to us. I believe\r\n          that the end of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle and the advent of\r\n          farming was connected to a psychological change that occurred in some\r\n          groups of people. There was a new sense of individuality and\r\n          separateness, which led to a new selfishness, and ultimately to\r\n          hierarchical societies, patriarchy and warfare.
