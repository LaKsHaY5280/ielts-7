There is a shallow stream which runs alongside the yellow\r\n          path. Dogs enjoy a swim here if it's hot, and there are trees to help\r\n          keep you cool while you wait.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">B Blackhill Trail</h4>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          Follow the marker posts carefully as you make your way through some\r\n          dense forest. If you take a wrong turn, as walkers often do, your walk\r\n          could end up being a lot longer than you expected. The sun may be\r\n          shining, but there is plenty of damp undergrowth, so wear a tough pair\r\n          of hiking boots if you don't want your feet to get wet. It isn't\r\n          advisable to take small dogs on this trail.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">C Fern Way</h4>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          The route is winding but fairly flat and doesn't require any special\r\n          footwear or equipment. It is accessed by a gate with a strong bolt to\r\n          keep sheep and cows in the field. The path is lined on both sides by\r\n          firs and some majestic redwoods that date back to the nineteenth\r\n          century. There are benches along the way, where you can rest and\r\n          admire the beauty of the area.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">D Bay Red Valley</h4>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          Be prepared to go up and down a bit on this route. The first section\r\n          is uphill, then the path flattens out — but not for long, so you need\r\n          to be fairly fit. The exercise is worth it, though, as there are some\r\n          spectacular views across the valley. There is a viewing platform, from\r\n          which you may be lucky enough to see one of the herds of deer that\r\n          roam the area.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">E Brownwater Trail</h4>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          A circular path will take you past tree and plant species from around\r\n          the world that are cared for by a dedicated team of volunteers. If you\r\n          bring your dog, keep it on a lead as the smaller shrubs can be easily\r\n          destroyed. The path itself is open and unprotected, so be sure to wear\r\n          a hat or you could get sunburnt.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mt-6 mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>Read the text below and answer Questions 7-14.</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-2\">Poppi Properties</h3>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2 italic\">Review by Sally Hanugoldi</p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          I have had a terrible experience with Poppi Properties and as an\r\n          ex-tenant, I advise you to go elsewhere if you want to rent or buy a\r\n          property — as I have now done. When I initially viewed my Poppi\r\n          Properties flat, I was accompanied by Lillee Eggerton, one of the two\r\n          staff who run the company. The flat was located close to the office\r\n          where I have been working for the past year, so I went there before\r\n          the working day had begun. I knew immediately that it was the right\r\n          property for me because of the convenient location, and a few days\r\n          later I paid the deposit and the first two months' rent. The flat was\r\n          on the 12th floor, which I admit was a surprise to me as I thought it\r\n          was lower when I first read about it, but Lillee was very encouraging,\r\n          and I felt confident that I was making the right choice. At this\r\n          point, she was professional and kind, but once I had moved into the\r\n          property, I discovered that she was far less approachable than she had\r\n          been during the viewing period and whenever I tried to contact her,\r\n          she was unavailable.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          At the start of my tenancy, a number of issues were unsatisfactory in\r\n          the property. For example, as a new tenant, you have a right to expect\r\n          your flat to be clean. In fact, carpets should be professionally\r\n          cleaned, but mine had not even been hoovered. I had hoped that this\r\n          problem would be addressed quickly, but nothing happened and so I did\r\n          the job myself. Similarly, the oven worked when I switched it on, but\r\n          it was black inside and smelt horrible. The company did nothing, so in\r\n          the end I just avoided using the oven while I lived there. Several\r\n          times, I asked to speak to the landlord directly but was told this was\r\n          not possible. No one should have to put up with these problems,\r\n          particularly when Poppi Properties charge such high rents!\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"reading-passage p-4 bg-white mb-4\">\r\n        <h2 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4\">SECTION 2</h2>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>Read the text below and answer Questions 15-21.</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-2\">\r\n          Procedure for making a complaint at work\r\n        </h3>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          If you have a problem or complaint at work, you might want to take\r\n          this up with your employer. This is called 'raising a grievance'.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          Often the best way to sort out a problem is to request an informal\r\n          meeting with your immediate manager to explain your concerns. You may\r\n          find it is possible to sort the problem out in this way without having\r\n          to take any further action. However, if you do not feel your problem\r\n          has been solved, you may decide to raise a formal grievance. In this\r\n          case you should first try to find out your company's grievance\r\n          procedure. You should be able to find details of this in your Company\r\n          Handbook, HR or Personnel manual, or on your company's HR intranet\r\n          site.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          The next step will probably be to write to your employer. Explain your\r\n          problem, and if you can think of a possible solution for resolving it,\r\n          give details of this. When you have written your letter, check that\r\n          you have written the date, and retain a copy so that you have a record\r\n          of what you wrote. Your employer should arrange an initial meeting at\r\n          a reasonable time and place to discuss your grievance. You are\r\n          entitled to ask either a colleague from work or a trade union\r\n          representative to go to the meeting with you. After the meeting, your\r\n          employer should write to you, telling you what they have decided to do\r\n          about your grievance.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          If you don't agree with your employer's decision, you have the right\r\n          to appeal against it. This must be done in writing. A further meeting\r\n          should then be called, which should be led by a more senior manager if\r\n          possible. If you are still not satisfied with the decision made at\r\n          this meeting, you may consider whether one way to solve the problem\r\n          might be through mediation. This may be done inside the company or by\r\n          an external agent. Alternatively, you can make an employment tribunal\r\n          claim. You must do this no more than three months after the time when\r\n          the event you are complaining about happened. If your application is\r\n          received after this time limit, the tribunal will not usually accept\r\n          it.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mt-6 mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>Read the text below and answer Questions 22-27.</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-2\">\r\n          Driving a taxi or private hire vehicle\r\n        </h3>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          Taxis are an important part of any town or city's transport system.\r\n          Taxis have a licence plate and roof sign that states they are a taxi.\r\n          As a taxi driver you might be booked in advance, wait on a taxi rank\r\n          or pick up passengers while on the move. You could combine normal\r\n          'pick-up' jobs with prearranged contracts such as regular trips for\r\n          schoolchildren or those unable to drive. You might also make\r\n          longer-distance trips such as taking people to airports. The other\r\n          type of passenger transport is a private hire vehicle. As a private\r\n          hire driver, you can only collect passengers who have pre-booked\r\n          through your operator. You cannot be flagged down in the street.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          When working in a taxi or private hire vehicle, you would:\r\n        </p>\r\n        <ul className=\"list-disc pl-6 mb-4\">\r\n          <li>\r\n            take job details over the radio from the operator at the office or\r\n            by an in-car computer\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>help to load and unload passengers' luggage</li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            assist passengers with any physical conditions that make it\r\n            difficult for them to get in and out of the vehicle\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>take payments</li>\r\n          <li>keep the vehicle clean and roadworthy</li>\r\n          <li>keep accounts and records, if self-employed.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">Working conditions and skills</h4>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          You would spend most of your time on the road, sometimes in heavy\r\n          traffic, and you would be constantly on the move. The job allows you\r\n          to choose your hours, but you will find more work in the evenings. You\r\n          would work between 40 and 60 hours a week if full time. In the UK, 17%\r\n          of taxi drivers are employed full time, 17% are employed part time and\r\n          66% are self-employed. As well as being a skilled driver, you need to\r\n          be good at communicating with people and helping customers. You must\r\n          be tactful when dealing with problems and have good time management\r\n          and numeracy skills.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">Requirements</h4>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          You will need a special licence from your local authority to be a taxi\r\n          driver or private car hire driver. For this, you usually need to be\r\n          over 21 years old, to have a clean current driving licence and to have\r\n          been driving for at least 12 months. You may also need to pass a test\r\n          of knowledge about the local geography. If you are using your own\r\n          vehicle, it will also need a special licence. Many employers value\r\n          additional driver training which could include the Advanced Driving\r\n          Test offered by the Institute of Advanced Motorists. Evidence of basic\r\n          mechanical skills, such as RQF level 4, would also be welcome.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"reading-passage p-4 bg-white mb-4\">\r\n        <h2 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4\">SECTION 3</h2>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>Read the text and answer Questions 28-40.</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-2\">Forced rhubarb</h3>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify italic\">\r\n          Rhubarb has large fan-shaped leaves and long, green edible stalks,\r\n          which are commonly cooked with sugar to make pies and other desserts.\r\n          One type of rhubarb is grown in the dark to produce longer, rosier\r\n          stalks and this is called 'forced rhubarb'.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">A</h4>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          In the north of England, a cold winter is good news for some, and not\r\n          just snowmen and woolly hat makers. According to Yorkshire farmer\r\n          David Westwood, this year's forced rhubarb is the best for years.\r\n          Westwood, a softly spoken Yorkshireman, should know. He's been growing\r\n          and selling rhubarb for 62 years, since he started picking on the farm\r\n          aged 11. His son Jonathan works on the farm too, making him the sixth\r\n          generation of the Westwoods to grow the pink stems or 'petioles' as\r\n          they are otherwise known.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">B</h4>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          We meet at his farm, a few miles from the city of Wakefield, which\r\n          with the cities of Bradford and Leeds form the three points of the\r\n          Rhubarb Triangle, the heart of the British rhubarb industry. 'It\r\n          doesn't grow as well anywhere else,' insists Westwood. He has a number\r\n          of theories as to why this is. The loam soil on a clay base is perfect\r\n          for the roots or \"crowns\" which rhubarb grows from. In Victorian times\r\n          — the mid-to-late 1800s – when rhubarb's popularity was at its peak,\r\n          the local coal mines provided cheap fuel for heating the sheds, a\r\n          crucial part of the forcing process, which involves depriving the\r\n          plants of light as they develop. At the same time, the effluence from\r\n          the industry enriched the soil for farmers. On top of that, according\r\n          to Westwood, the high levels of pollution in the air would have been\r\n          ideal for the rhubarb, as 'rhubarb loves soot'.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">C</h4>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          Westwood's farm produces both the greenish outdoor rhubarb, the kind\r\n          that grows well in gardens all over the country, and the startlingly\r\n          pink forced rhubarb. It's this that is the 'cream of the crop', the\r\n          upper class of the rhubarb family. Forced rhubarb is the one that's\r\n          most likely to convert rhubarb-haters who've been traumatized by\r\n          harshly flavoured school pies made from green overgrown outdoor stems.\r\n          The slender magenta spears, with a sherbet-tangy flavour and delicate\r\n          texture, are a far cry from that coarse, bitter stuff. It's also a\r\n          rare local fruit (although technically a vegetable) at a time when\r\n          imports dominate, and a welcome splash of colour in the drab winter\r\n          months. No wonder chefs and food writers have fallen in love with\r\n          forced rhubarb all over again. It's enjoying a remarkable renaissance,\r\n          for only 20 years ago it was in such decline that Westwood, one of the\r\n          last 12 growers left from a peak of 200, was considering abandoning\r\n          it.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">D</h4>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          There are certainly simpler ways to grow food. First the plant roots,\r\n          or crowns, are grown outside for more than two years. Then, at the\r\n          start of their third winter, they are left in the ground until it is\r\n          cold enough to break the crowns' dormancy. This is one of the factors\r\n          that gives British rhubarb the edge over imports from the Netherlands,\r\n          which arrive in the country a scene-stealing couple of weeks before\r\n          the Yorkshire crop. To bring them to market that early, the Dutch\r\n          crowns are fed with gibberellic acid, to replace the hormones\r\n          naturally generated by a period of cold weather. Westwood is relaxed\r\n          on the subject of the imported rhubarb, remarking only: 'It's\r\n          good-looking all right, but the flavour's nowhere near.' Back in\r\n          Yorkshire, sometime around the middle of November, the crowns are dug\r\n          up, transferred to sheds with earthen floors, and watered in. The\r\n          light is blocked out completely and the heating is turned on. In the\r\n          warm and dark, the shoots appear so quickly that the buds can be heard\r\n          gently popping. Within three weeks or so, the first round of picking,\r\n          or 'pulling' as it's known, can begin.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">E</h4>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          In Westwood's 1920s rhubarb sheds, it is pitch black. I slip and slide\r\n          on the narrow troughs that serve as paths between the beds of rhubarb\r\n          crowns. It's a relief when a team of 'pullers' arrive, all local men,\r\n          some of whom have been working for Westwood for 40 years. Each carries\r\n          a sturdy candle, and their pale, flickering light reveals a sea of\r\n          yellow leaves stretching 40 metres to the far wall. The men walk the\r\n          beds plucking the satiny stems expertly, choosing only the ones that\r\n          have reached the length of an arm. Then, cradling the fuchsia pink\r\n          bundles in their arms, they move on to the next patch. It's an\r\n          extraordinary sight in this age of mechanised, computerised\r\n          agriculture. 'The pulling's done much the same way as it always has\r\n          been,' Westwood says. 'Electric light spoils the colour.' A\r\n          labour-intensive process, it goes some way to explain the admittedly\r\n          eye-watering price of the best forced rhubarb – that and the heating,\r\n          now from oil or propane rather than coal.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">F</h4>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 text-justify\">\r\n          So how was this arcane cold-dark-heat process, in use since Victorian\r\n          times, discovered? Westwood's story is appealingly earthy. A gardener\r\n          threw an old crown onto the horse stable muck pile. The manure was\r\n          hot, and the plant was soon covered. The stable boy must have been\r\n          puzzled by the startling pink spears that came pushing through the\r\n          dirt a week or two later, but happily he had the good sense to gather\r\n          them. Where there's muck there's money – and good eating indeed.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>",
