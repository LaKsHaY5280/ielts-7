They reward their parents' friends with smiles\r\n          and squeals while saving tears and frowns for those they don't like\r\n          the look of. They are learning to reach some form of emotional\r\n          synchronicity with the wider world.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          It's a formative developmental period. Yet psychologist Michael\r\n          Tomasello wanted to know more about the point in human development\r\n          when babies learn to collaborate and share. He carried out a study in\r\n          Germany that involved babies aged from 9 to 18 months encountering a\r\n          succession of different scenarios. For example, a researcher would\r\n          play with blocks in front of the child and then knock down the stack.\r\n          Babies of under 14 months would, he found, generally look on\r\n          impassively. Those over 14 months, however, would show concern, try to\r\n          comfort the adult, and even help rebuild the stack.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          In another experiment, an adult pretended not to be able to reach a\r\n          ball while the baby looked on. Again, babies under 14 months showed no\r\n          reaction, but older ones helped by crawling to the ball and picking it\r\n          up. Tomasello's research is the first hard evidence that while babies\r\n          of 9 months cooperate with their parents, babies of 14 to 18 months\r\n          cooperate with strangers too, and on tasks they've never seen before.\r\n          'This sort of thing is not learned,' he says. 'It seems to come\r\n          naturally.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          This view opposes the longstanding idea that very young humans are\r\n          entirely selfish. In fact, scientists have found that, by their first\r\n          birthdays, babies do appreciate the importance of another's\r\n          intentions, something which Tomasello says is the basic psychological\r\n          process needed for collaboration. And until now, there was no known\r\n          mechanism that could help explain child cooperation. The idea that\r\n          empathy is innate explains a lot. It could be our capacity to identify\r\n          with others that makes humans such a successfully collaborative\r\n          species.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The next stage in Tomasello's research is to see whether babies also\r\n          understand the concept of fairness. His team carried out research in\r\n          which babies of just 3 months were shown animations of simple shapes\r\n          either cooperating or being aggressive or helpful or obstructive.\r\n          These very young subjects showed a distinct preference in looking at\r\n          the more helpful shapes. But perhaps the most remarkable experiment\r\n          was one in which 15-month-old babies had the opportunity to witness an\r\n          adult struggling to try to get into a cupboard with his hands full.\r\n          Though babies this age will often help a stranger with simple tasks,\r\n          they are not generally given the opportunity to observe someone who\r\n          doesn't realise they need help, and might not be expected to respond.\r\n          Yet these subjects frequently took the initiative to help the adult.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The study of child development suggests that empathy is innate. But\r\n          then how can we explain the likes of King Leopold II of Belgium (a\r\n          cruel despot in Africa), Adolf Hitler, or the type of person who\r\n          enjoys torturing others? Are they just exceptional individuals who\r\n          have unlearned empathy? Frans de Waal, a professor of primate\r\n          behaviour at Emory University in Atlanta, believes indeed the problem\r\n          is not switching on empathy, it's switching it off. Normal humans have\r\n          evolved a very strong tendency to empathise with others, irrespective\r\n          of identity of the other individual. However, there are various\r\n          conditions, such as the social pressure to conform (as in Nazi\r\n          Germany), where a sort of empathy is switched off. Any discussion of\r\n          empathy must consider both the degree to which it is intrinsic to\r\n          humans and the factors that make humans turn away from it.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Experiments using painful stimuli have shown that the same areas of\r\n          the brain are activated whether men are receiving pain or observing\r\n          others receiving it. However, when asked to rate the level of this\r\n          pain, the men gave lower ratings for others' pain than for their own.\r\n          This makes evolutionary sense. If people felt others' pain as severely\r\n          as they do their own, surely they would never be able to function in\r\n          emergency situations where others are suffering, or indeed in any\r\n          situation where difficult actions need to be taken for the common\r\n          good.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          A study in the Netherlands, which enables us to understand more of\r\n          this, examined brain activity in adults who watched a game of\r\n          ball-tossing. The subjects could see three people playing with the\r\n          ball, with one player deliberately excluded by the other two. The\r\n          subjects' brain activity was monitored by a brain scanning technique.\r\n          Then the subjects were invited to join in the game. As we might\r\n          expect, they threw the ball to the isolated player more often than to\r\n          the other (excluding) players, showing a greater degree of empathy\r\n          towards the less fortunate player. While watching the exclusion\r\n          scenario, the areas of the subjects' brains that process emotion and\r\n          physical pain had lit up on the scan – along with another area. This\r\n          was the pre-motor cortex, which is activated when a person is planning\r\n          a physical movement. So not only were the subjects registering the\r\n          pain of exclusion, but they were also planning to help the excluded\r\n          player. Empathy, it seems, is linked to action.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          But this notion that we literally 'feel' for others is relatively new\r\n          to science, as a result of such brain scan research. For most of the\r\n          20th century, standard neuroscience held that the brain and emotions\r\n          such as empathy were in separate domains. Emotions, it was thought,\r\n          were physically represented only in the autonomic nervous system – the\r\n          nerves that control involuntary functions such as heartbeats, sneezes,\r\n          and digestion. Then in 1994, neuroscientist Antonio Damasio published\r\n          a groundbreaking book, Descartes' Error, which showed that people with\r\n          damage to the part of the brain where emotions are processed found it\r\n          very hard to make decisions. Damasio's research provided support for\r\n          the idea that what we call 'thoughts' are actually feelings.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          But this notion does not have universal acceptance, and empathy itself\r\n          remains difficult to study. There is a world of difference between\r\n          empathising with the stress of exclusion from a ball game, for\r\n          example, and the trauma of a major disaster. As Dr Tania Singer, one\r\n          of the leading researchers in empathy at University College, London,\r\n          notes: 'We still don't know whether these empathic brain responses are\r\n          specific to the infliction of pain in social contexts, or whether they\r\n          also extend to other emotions such as disgust or fear.'\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      {/* READING PASSAGE 2 */}\r\n      <div className=\"mb-8\">\r\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4\">READING PASSAGE 2</h3>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 14-27</strong>,\r\n          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-2\">The Discovery of Uranus</h4>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          In 1781, astronomer William Herschel was looking through his telescope\r\n          as part of his project to chart all the stars visible from Earth. As\r\n          he was observing, he noticed what he thought was a comet. It was an\r\n          object which moved against the background stars, but did not have the\r\n          fuzzy appearance or the tail that is characteristic of comets. After\r\n          following its motion for a number of nights, Herschel sent his\r\n          observations to other scientists, who were also unable to identify the\r\n          object as a previously known celestial body. A few months later it was\r\n          determined that Herschel had discovered not a comet, but a new planet\r\n          - which eventually was named Uranus, after the ancient Greek god of\r\n          the sky.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Although Uranus is one of the giant gas planets in our solar system -\r\n          about 50 times the size of Earth - it is so far away that it is barely\r\n          visible to the naked eye, and only under very good conditions. It\r\n          would have been observed by many early astronomers, but since these\r\n          observers didn't recognise the object as a planet, it was usually\r\n          classified as a star. In fact, in his work The True System of the\r\n          World, published in 1740, scientist Thomas Wright suggested that faint\r\n          blurs of light observed through telescopes might in fact be distant\r\n          planetary systems, but his ideas were too advanced for his time and\r\n          were not investigated by the scientific community.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          In 1690, the first known observation of Uranus as something other than\r\n          a fixed star was made by the English astronomer John Flamsteed, who\r\n          catalogued it as a star. Flamsteed observed Uranus at least six times.\r\n          Seventy years later, a French astronomer named Pierre Lemonnier also\r\n          recorded the planet's position a number of times between 1750 and\r\n          1769, but on each occasion, he also failed to recognise the object as\r\n          a planet.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          There is evidence that normal people had noticed Uranus much earlier\r\n          than that. Ancient Greek and Chinese texts suggest that people could\r\n          sometimes see Uranus, despite the planet's dimness. It is now thought\r\n          that the planet was just at the limit of what could be seen by human\r\n          eyes, and would disappear from view when atmospheric conditions were\r\n          not ideal. Some researchers claim that the Babylonians made\r\n          observations of Uranus, and that the oldest reliable sighting of\r\n          Uranus was by the Greek astronomer Hipparchos in 128 B.C.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          With the publication of his Almagest star catalogue in the 2nd Century\r\n          A.D., the influential Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy appears to have\r\n          included the coordinates of Uranus as a star. The planet was also\r\n          recorded by a number of Arabic astronomers in the Middle Ages.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          It is sometimes said that Uranus was first identified as a planet by\r\n          the amateur astronomer William Herschel. Although this is technically\r\n          correct, it is unfair, since Herschel had not initially realised that\r\n          he had discovered a planet either. It was his subsequent\r\n          correspondence with a colleague, Nevil Maskelyne, which led to the\r\n          realisation that his 'comet' was actually a planet. Herschel, though,\r\n          obtained all the credit, something which seemed to please him greatly,\r\n          as it led to his appointment as The King's Astronomer, even though he\r\n          was not even a professional astronomer, but a musician.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          So why is Uranus so hard to see? It's considerably larger than the\r\n          Earth, but much further away. The two planets are separated by up to 3\r\n          billion kilometers. The great distance means that Uranus receives much\r\n          less light from the sun than our planet, and because it doesn't\r\n          produce light of its own, the sunlight it reflects towards the Earth\r\n          is much weaker than light reflected by closer planets.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Another factor is that Uranus, like other gas giants such as Jupiter\r\n          and Saturn, doesn't have a solid surface. It consists of a solid core\r\n          surrounded by a gaseous outer layer, which is composed of about 83 per\r\n          cent hydrogen, 15 per cent helium and 2 per cent methane. The methane\r\n          absorbs the red spectrum of sunlight, giving the planet a blue-green\r\n          colour, and making it even harder to see at a distance.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Uranus has been visited by just one space probe, Voyager 2, in the\r\n          1980s. It transmitted back pictures of a rather boring, featureless\r\n          planet, with a uniform blue-green appearance. Though not as\r\n          spectacular as its neighbour Saturn, with its magnificent rings,\r\n          Uranus also possesses a system of rings - thirteen in all, though they\r\n          are very faint. However, a new study by astronomers at the University\r\n          of California has revealed a surprising fact: Uranus does not just\r\n          rotate predictably, like most other planets in our solar system, but\r\n          tumbles around erratically, like a football after it's been kicked.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          This is because Uranus has an extreme axis of rotation - it's tilted\r\n          by 98 degrees, which means that one of its poles always points roughly\r\n          towards the sun. All other planets spin rather like a top, but Uranus\r\n          rolls around its orbit rather like a ball. Now, researchers are\r\n          suggesting that this strange rotation is due to the fact that Uranus\r\n          was struck by a huge object, possibly as large as the Earth. The\r\n          collision must have occurred shortly after the solar system was\r\n          formed, and it seems that Uranus has never recovered from it.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          There have been calls from scientists for a new unmanned mission to\r\n          Uranus, as there is so much we still don't know about the planet.\r\n          Space organisations are considering one such mission, tentatively\r\n          called the Uranus Orbiter and Probe. But there are no concrete plans\r\n          to visit the planet again at present, due to the vast distance that\r\n          would need to be covered, and the enormous costs involved. Thus, for\r\n          the foreseeable future, our knowledge of the planet will continue to\r\n          depend on our Earth-based telescopes.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      {/* READING PASSAGE 3 */}\r\n      <div className=\"mb-8\">\r\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4\">READING PASSAGE 3</h3>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 28-40</strong>,\r\n          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-2\">The Origin of Laughter</h4>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Laughter consists of two parts – a set of gestures and the production\r\n          of a sound. The brain forces a regular, staccato noise. When we laugh,\r\n          our arterial blood pressure increases, our facial colour darkens, the\r\n          whole brain receives an electrical stimulation and the heart rate\r\n          rises to 120 beats per minute. Laughter is a pleasant feeling, but it\r\n          seems non-sensical: it involves the muscles of both happiness (the\r\n          zygomatic major) and those of grief. The body is therefore obliged to\r\n          react to the feeling that all is well, and also its opposite.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          When did laughter begin? Is it something we do as humans, or does it\r\n          have biological prerequisites which we find in other species? Human\r\n          laughter has been found by anthropologists in even the remotest\r\n          cultures, including those which had never been exposed to Western\r\n          culture. And the human facial expression of enjoyment corresponds, to\r\n          a high degree, to the 'play face' found in our closest primate\r\n          ancestors – chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. This play face can\r\n          be seen in the youngest primates, is muscularly controlled in the same\r\n          way as in humans, and serves a similar social function of bonding\r\n          between members of the species.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Where, then, is the dividing line between us and our primate\r\n          ancestors? Professor of Psychology Marina Davila-Ross of Portsmouth\r\n          University made what is considered the first evolutionary analysis of\r\n          primate laughter. 'The great apes have a similar facial expression\r\n          when they are playing – they show their teeth in a grin, their eyes\r\n          are bright, they pant excitedly,' she says. 'I present young\r\n          chimpanzees with audio recordings of all the other ape species'\r\n          'laughter', and they preferred to go on playing when they heard\r\n          another of their own species laugh.' It seems, then, that the\r\n          evolution of laughter in humans was a pre-existing ability. But humans\r\n          are different from all of the other species, according to Professor\r\n          Michael Owren of Georgia State University in the US. 'Their laugh is\r\n          kind of a breathy exhalation and inhalation. It sounds like a pant\r\n          laugh, kind of similar to a dog's panting. Human laughter has been\r\n          ritualised. It has become much more stereotyped, much more rhythmic\r\n          and much more complicated acoustically.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The creation of the laugh as we know it is to do with the fact that\r\n          the human larynx moved downwards as we began to walk upright, and our\r\n          brains started to increase in size. The laugh became something more\r\n          refined. 'Our laughter is a vocalisation which evolved as a way of\r\n          signalling positive emotion to others. That's why it became rhythmic\r\n          and complicated,' says Owren. But this analysis raises a new question.\r\n          If the motivation is simply to communicate happiness, then why is\r\n          laughter so complex, with both positive and negative muscular\r\n          movements involved? And why do we go into this strange 'second state'?\r\n          The answer lies in the realm of neuro-psychology.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Robert Provine of the University of Maryland identified the\r\n          evolutionary basis of humour and laughter. He found that the modern\r\n          human brain has an ancient neural circuit that it uses exclusively for\r\n          laughter. It also has a more recently evolved circuit in a different\r\n          region, the cerebral cortex, which deals with complex thought. So the\r\n          reason that we are convulsed when we laugh and go into a kind of\r\n          temporary madness, Provine suggested, is that we are triggering a very\r\n          primitive circuit that temporarily takes over from our more rational,\r\n          higher brain. And probably the reason for the involvement of pain is\r\n          similar. 'Laughter is a kind of explosion, with a beginning but no\r\n          well-defined end,' says Provine. 'There's no real way of stopping it\r\n          once it gets going, and it is a kind of mini-seizure.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Evolutionary psychologists and neurologists are now converging on a\r\n          theory about the development of laughter. The idea is that one way in\r\n          which the brain evolved was that elements of emotional regulation were\r\n          added to cognitive awareness of the world around us. This became more\r\n          pronounced as humans began to band together in ever-larger social\r\n          groups. 'The human brain doubled in size in two million years,' says\r\n          neuro-psychologist Paul MacLean of Stanford University. One of the\r\n          primary causes of all this growth was the need to keep track of social\r\n          awareness in an environment where the individual and the group had to\r\n          be balanced. How so? Well, the argument goes that the explosion of\r\n          social data and social management was a major trigger for expanding\r\n          the brain's activity.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Professor Sophie Scott of University College, London has made a\r\n          connection between laughter in primates and tickling, which works in a\r\n          very similar way. 'When you tickle primates, they have the same\r\n          reaction as humans,' she says. 'They push you away at the same time as\r\n          they seem to want more.' She adds that tickling animals in the paw or\r\n          stomach is connected to knowing where they are vulnerable. The play\r\n          appears to be a rehearsal for real situations. So the real beneficial\r\n          feature of tickling may be that it proves harmlessness while focusing\r\n          on vulnerability. It tells the tickled creature that the tickler is\r\n          someone they can trust. So when something switches from vulnerability\r\n          to harmlessness, the play face – which is a reassuring grin with\r\n          panting – instinctively follows.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Scott goes further. In modern humans, she suggests, laughter has\r\n          developed into a much more subtle signaling system. It's true that\r\n          when we live in close social spaces we use laughter to bond with those\r\n          we want as friends. But the sound of the laugh has developed another\r\n          social function. 'Laughter is a fast social emotion in humans,' says\r\n          Scott. 'A real belly laugh goes \"Ha-ha-ha-ha\" in a regular rhythm at\r\n          about four laughs per second. When we do it, other people can't help\r\n          but be infected by it.' Brain scans show that people hear the sound,\r\n          process its meaning, and their bodies move in response, all in less\r\n          than half a second. 'People do join in,' she says. 'We've shown it in\r\n          the lab. Putting subjects in a brain scanner, it's hard to get them to\r\n          stay still when they hear laughter.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          But to discover the function of 'emotional contagion', as\r\n          psychologists now call it, various uncertainties need to be examined.\r\n          Some theories suggest that when laughter is emotive, it reinforces\r\n          social bonding, and when it's cognitive and occurs in response to\r\n          wordplay, for example, it can have a distancing effect. Emotive\r\n          laughter is cross-cultural whereas cognitive laughter is often lost in\r\n          translation. But the larger purpose may simply be that both increase\r\n          control in the flow of information and social exchange. Scott's\r\n          research on laughter is very much a work in progress. She has found\r\n          that women 'laugh much more than men in social interactions', which\r\n          appears to point to the link between laughter and bonding. With its\r\n          breath control issue, she believes that laughter may have been a major\r\n          factor in the development of speech.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>",
