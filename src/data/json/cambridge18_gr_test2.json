It involves peaceful protests\r\n              against laws or government demands that are regarded as unjust.\r\n              Practitioners of civil disobedience may be seeking to change the\r\n              law that they are opposing, or they may simply be looking to\r\n              obstruct the operation of the law or government policy.\r\n              Alternatively, a person who employs civil disobedience may not\r\n              actually object to the law they are breaking, but they consider it\r\n              necessary to protest against what they regard as a greater\r\n              injustice. Most activists who employ civil disobedience are\r\n              choosing to disobey the law non-violently, rather than resorting\r\n              to armed resistance or other forms of violent protest, which might\r\n              include damage to property or harm to individuals. They are\r\n              generally willing to accept the legal consequences of their\r\n              actions, although there are exceptions to this. It is this\r\n              acceptance of the legal consequences that has been influential in\r\n              changing both laws and wider attitudes towards civil disobedience.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <h4 className=\"font-semibold mb-2\">B</h4>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Historically, there are a number of civil disobedience movements\r\n              of significance. Henry David Thoreau's 1849 essay Civil\r\n              Disobedience, entitled 'Resistance to Civil Government', is a key\r\n              text. In this well-known essay, Thoreau argues for a priority of\r\n              individual conscience over government legislation. Before and\r\n              during the American Civil War, citizens who helped runaway slaves\r\n              were acting in breach of the law, but they were following the\r\n              dictates of their consciences. Thoreau himself resisted the\r\n              imposition of taxes that would be used to fund the US war against\r\n              Mexico, and was briefly imprisoned for his refusal. Despite this,\r\n              he was relatively privileged compared to those actively resisting\r\n              slavery. He was not pursued vigorously by the state because of his\r\n              actions. Some of his neighbors actually paid the taxes on his\r\n              behalf, which led to his release, but he protested even against\r\n              this intervention.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <h4 className=\"font-semibold mb-2\">C</h4>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Mohandas (later 'Mahatma', or 'Great Soul') Gandhi was influenced\r\n              by Thoreau and was one of the most important 20th-century\r\n              proponents of civil disobedience. In South Africa, he led\r\n              campaigns against restrictions on immigration, and later, on\r\n              racial discrimination. Upon returning to India, he organized a\r\n              long series of campaigns against British rule. For Gandhi, the\r\n              notion of civil disobedience was strongly linked to his wider\r\n              philosophy and religious beliefs. He advocated a policy of\r\n              non-violence, believing that the use of violence against the\r\n              British would simply replace one source of oppression with\r\n              another. His view was that if he employed violence to achieve his\r\n              aims, it would be harder to resist the desire for revenge once the\r\n              British had been overcome. He therefore believed that if India was\r\n              to be truly independent and genuinely peaceful, the means used to\r\n              achieve those goals had to be consistent with his belief in\r\n              non-violence. In some cases, however, Gandhi's civil disobedience\r\n              campaigns were called off because they had led to violence. The\r\n              British Viceroy, Lord Irwin, was aware that forcible suppression\r\n              of the movement would lead to widespread violence, so the protests\r\n              became a factor in the British decision to remove themselves from\r\n              the governing of India, albeit after a long struggle.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <h4 className=\"font-semibold mb-2\">D</h4>\r\n            <p>\r\n              In the United States, under the leadership of Martin Luther King,\r\n              civil disobedience became a powerful part of the Civil Rights\r\n              movement. In the face of continuing racial segregation, even after\r\n              the Supreme Court ruled that separate schools for black and white\r\n              children were not equal, activists adopted a series of tactics to\r\n              resist the law. In 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks refused\r\n              to give up her seat to a white person on a bus - a protest that\r\n              led to a boycott of the bus company by supporters of the Civil\r\n              Rights movement. The aim was to target the company's revenues. The\r\n              boycott was a success, and the US Supreme Court eventually ruled\r\n              that the local law requiring segregation on Montgomery buses was\r\n              unconstitutional.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <h4 className=\"font-semibold mb-2\">E</h4>\r\n            <p>\r\n              In the UK, the suffragette movement of the early 20th century\r\n              campaigned to get the vote for women. Their tactics included\r\n              disruption of daily life through civil disobedience, such as\r\n              chaining themselves to railings, pouring chemicals into mailboxes\r\n              to damage the mail, breaking windows and even arson. The mass\r\n              civil disobedience of the suffragettes and the attempts to\r\n              suppress their activities led to around 1,000 imprisonments. Many\r\n              of them went on hunger strike in prison, which led to the\r\n              authorities force-feeding them. Faced with continuing protests,\r\n              bad publicity from the suffering of women when force-fed, and\r\n              unwillingness to release the women, the government felt forced to\r\n              pass the Prisoner's Temporary Discharge Act in 1913. This allowed\r\n              the temporary discharge of prisoners who were so weakened by\r\n              hunger striking that they were at risk of death, but meant that\r\n              they could be re-imprisoned to serve out the rest of their\r\n              sentence once they had recovered. This law became known as the\r\n              'Cat and Mouse Act' and was criticized as inhumane. Nonetheless,\r\n              one of the important legacies of the suffragette movement was the\r\n              lesson that the vote could be won, and the law changed, by direct\r\n              action, rather than purely by constitutional means.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <h4 className=\"font-semibold mb-2\">F</h4>\r\n            <p>\r\n              A number of environmentalist groups have employed methods of civil\r\n              disobedience in opposition to nuclear weaponry and power stations.\r\n              For instance, in 1982 a group of women began a peace camp outside\r\n              the Greenham Common Royal Air Force base in Berkshire, England,\r\n              protesting against the siting of 96 cruise missiles there. In\r\n              1983, during demonstrations which aimed to disrupt the\r\n              transportation of the missiles into the base, more than 750 women\r\n              were arrested for 'obstructing the highway'. A series of similar\r\n              actions over the coming years resulted in more arrests, including\r\n              one of 200 women on a single day in December 1983. The missiles\r\n              were in fact installed on the base, but the campaigners continued\r\n              to surround it until the weapons were removed and the airbase\r\n              closed. The peace camp came to an end in 2000.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <h4 className=\"font-semibold mb-2\">G</h4>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Today, civil disobedience continues to be a significant form of\r\n              political activism, with examples ranging from mass protests\r\n              against government corruption to individuals refusing to comply\r\n              with laws they believe are unjust. Many middle-class individuals,\r\n              who might not have been politically active previously, may engage\r\n              in this form of protest, sometimes when conventional political\r\n              means have proven unsuccessful. In contemporary society, the use\r\n              of social media to report civil disobedience may mean there is\r\n              greater awareness of these protests, making it more difficult for\r\n              authorities to dismiss or suppress civil disobedience, or to\r\n              control the narrative surrounding such events. Thus, while the\r\n              tactics of civil disobedience have not changed radically since the\r\n              early 20th century, their impact may be amplified by 21st century\r\n              technology.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mt-6 mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>Questions 9-14</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Do the following statements agree with the information given in the\r\n          text?\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">In boxes 9-14 on your answer sheet, write</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-1\">\r\n          <strong>TRUE</strong> if the statement agrees with the information\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-1\">\r\n          <strong>FALSE</strong> if the statement contradicts the information\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>NOT GIVEN</strong> if there is no information on this\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"reading-passage p-4 bg-white mt-8\">\r\n        <h2 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4\">SECTION 2</h2>\r\n\r\n        <h3 className=\"font-bold mb-4\">WORKPLACE WELLNESS</h3>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <strong>Questions 15-27</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">Read the text below and complete the notes.</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Choose <strong>NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS</strong> from the text for each\r\n          answer.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Write your answers in boxes 15-27 on your answer sheet.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"passage-text space-y-4\">\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <p>\r\n              Creating a healthier workplace environment results in reduced\r\n              absenteeism and staff turnover, increased employee engagement, and\r\n              improved morale, which can all contribute to greater productivity.\r\n              Research has shown that supporting your employees to be healthier\r\n              and happier at work does not need to be expensive.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <h4 className=\"font-semibold mb-2\">Healthy eating</h4>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Encourage healthier eating by replacing soda with filtered tap\r\n              water.

It encompasses a\r\n              number of different techniques that have been practiced for\r\n              hundreds of years. They include woodcuts, engravings, etchings,\r\n              lithographs and screen-printing, all of which require specialist\r\n              skills and equipment, and all of which have been used, and are\r\n              still used, by artists to produce high-quality prints of their\r\n              work.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <p>\r\n              In the early days of printing, woodcuts and copper plate\r\n              engravings were the principal techniques. A copper-plate engraving\r\n              was made by cutting the image into the metal. When the plate was\r\n              inked, the ink remained in the sunken lines of the image and was\r\n              transferred to paper when the plate and paper were squeezed\r\n              together in a press, leaving an impression of the image. As the\r\n              paper was pressed into the lines of the engraving, a ridge of\r\n              paper was raised on the back of the print, and the ink stood proud\r\n              of the paper. A print expert would look for these signs to\r\n              identify a copper engraving. As the copper plate had to be\r\n              engraved in reverse – in other words, the image had to be cut into\r\n              the plate backwards compared to the way it would be printed out –\r\n              the process had technical difficulties.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <p>\r\n              Nevertheless, copper engraving became more and more sophisticated\r\n              over time. In Italy in the early 16th century, Marcantonio\r\n              Raimondi produced prints of unprecedented quality from engravings,\r\n              which he was using to reproduce paintings. He realized that since\r\n              the copper plate could be printed many times, the art of the great\r\n              painters could become available to people who could not otherwise\r\n              have afforded to see or purchase the originals. However, the labor\r\n              involved in copper engraving was considerable, and engravings were\r\n              still expensive, especially ones that were printed using colored\r\n              inks. By the 17th century, only rulers and the very rich could\r\n              afford to commission original prints from copper-plate engravers,\r\n              and less wealthy people had to be satisfied with maps and pictures\r\n              in books.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <p>\r\n              Although the techniques of engraving were not in themselves\r\n              scientifically sophisticated, they were used by scientists in\r\n              communicating their ideas and discoveries. In the 18th century,\r\n              biological illustrations usually started by drawing directly from\r\n              the subject, and were valued according to their accuracy of\r\n              representation. Their inclusion in scientific journals helped to\r\n              promote the work of the featured scientists. In 1798, the Lombardy\r\n              Academy of Science in Italy recommended that lithography should be\r\n              used for scientific illustration. Unlike copper-plate engraving,\r\n              stone lithography allows a wide range of tonal variations and an\r\n              artist can draw directly onto the stone without the need for\r\n              engraving. This innovation made print-making much faster; it meant\r\n              that many more prints could be run off, and in time led to the\r\n              emergence of mass-market magazines.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <p>\r\n              Major advances came in the early 19th century with the\r\n              introduction of lithography, which was invented in 1798 by Alois\r\n              Senefelder. Senefelder had been looking for a cheap way to publish\r\n              theatrical works, and found that he could use wax to draw on a\r\n              stone plate, which was then treated with chemicals, so that when\r\n              ink was applied to the stone, it stuck only to the areas where the\r\n              drawing had been done. This enabled him to transfer his designs to\r\n              paper by pressing them on the stone. This became a popular\r\n              technique with artists, because they could draw directly onto the\r\n              stone instead of having to use a printer as an intermediary.\r\n              Famous artists like Manet, Degas and Picasso enthusiastically\r\n              embraced lithography, and many artists today still use stone\r\n              lithography to create prints of their own designs and artwork.\r\n              With the continued development of lithography, color reproduction\r\n              techniques advanced.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <p>\r\n              By the early 20th century, photographic printing techniques had\r\n              been refined to the point where it was possible to make excellent\r\n              color reproductions of paintings. Print-making had declined as a\r\n              medium for artists, although certain major artists continued to\r\n              produce etchings and lithographs, using the form as a medium in\r\n              its own right, rather than merely a way to reproduce an image. For\r\n              example, the Spanish artist Goya created an entire sequence of\r\n              prints, entitled 'Caprichos', which allowed him to express himself\r\n              freely. Printmaking was an essential part of his output, and in\r\n              total he produced some 270 prints. Developments in photography\r\n              seemed to have made the artist-printmaker obsolete, but the growth\r\n              of a mass consumer society, and with it the emergence of mass\r\n              advertising in the early 20th century, meant that the skills of\r\n              the printmaker were still in demand, especially in the form of\r\n              screen-printing, which was a cheap way of making bold, striking\r\n              posters.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <p>\r\n              Screen-printing has a history that goes back to the earliest forms\r\n              of stencil-making in China around 1000 years ago. From China, the\r\n              craft spread to Japan, where the stencil technique was applied to\r\n              fabric. The Japanese used human hair to create a mesh that\r\n              supported the design. By the early 20th century, fabric was being\r\n              used instead of hair, and squeegees replaced brushes for pushing\r\n              the ink through the mesh. Today, most screen-printing is carried\r\n              out using a photo stencil made from a light-sensitive gelatin,\r\n              which is exposed to the image in a process similar to that used in\r\n              photography. Parts of the gelatin become hardened when exposed to\r\n              light, while the areas that remain in shadow can be washed away,\r\n              allowing the ink to penetrate the screen and print onto the\r\n              surface placed below. Most screen-printing is done on a commercial\r\n              basis to mass-produce a specified image, although many artists do\r\n              screen-printing as part of their practice.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <p>\r\n              Contemporary artists use computer-aided printing of various kinds\r\n              when they want to mass-produce their own work, or when they choose\r\n              to work in that medium as part of their creative practice. Some\r\n              artists continue to use traditional printing techniques such as\r\n              linocuts, wood carving and lithography, delighting in the\r\n              particularities of the chosen medium. And many contemporary\r\n              artists combine old and new techniques or import images from one\r\n              medium into another to create interesting effects.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <p>\r\n              Although its primary purpose is reproductive, making prints is\r\n              also a creative process, and artists and illustrators continue to\r\n              use all of the techniques described above to produce\r\n              limited-edition prints of their work. These are signed and\r\n              numbered by the artist, and are sold through galleries in editions\r\n              of 15 to 50 copies of each image. These days, such prints are\r\n              highly regarded by art critics and collectors. Prints are no\r\n              longer viewed as inferior to other art forms such as paintings or\r\n              drawings, and they are purchased by major galleries and private\r\n              collectors.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"paragraph\">\r\n            <h4 className=\"font-semibold mb-2\">Screen Printing</h4>\r\n            <p>\r\n              A screen print is made by pressing ink through a mesh, parts of\r\n              which have been obscured by a stencil so that the ink only\r\n              penetrates the open areas, creating an image on a surface placed\r\n              beneath the mesh. The mesh, which is stretched tightly across a\r\n              frame, is traditionally made of fabric, although metal or nylon\r\n              may also be used. An artist starts the process by making a drawing\r\n              or design, which is followed by the construction of a stencil to\r\n              recreate the design. The stencil can be made in various ways, such\r\n              as by cutting shapes from paper, or by painting parts of the\r\n              screen with a liquid which dries and blocks the screen.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The technique of screen printing was first used in China. The\r\n              Chinese used human hair to construct the mesh. A stencil was\r\n              created, and ink forced through the mesh using a stiff brush. In\r\n              the early 20th century, printers in the West began to use the\r\n              technique. Modern stencils used in screen printing are typically\r\n              made using photo-sensitive gelatins, which go hard when exposed to\r\n              light. This allows very fine detail to be created.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Some artists prefer to create stencils with a geometric pattern,\r\n              which can be repeated to create a design, while others may prefer\r\n              to work with photographic images. Because the screen can be used\r\n              many times, it is easy to create multicolored prints by printing\r\n              one color at a time, using a different screen for each color.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              While the process is part of what makes a screen print\r\n              distinctive, artists also need to choose what surface to print on.\r\n              Many artists choose newspaper, but other options include plastic,\r\n              card or even knitwear.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>",

className=\"mb-4\">\r\n              A screen print is created when ink is pushed through the mesh of a\r\n              screen, parts of which have been blocked using a stencil. The\r\n              screen is made of <strong>36</strong>{\" \"}\r\n              <Input type=\"text\" className=\"w-32 mx-1 inline-block\" /> which is\r\n              finely woven and stretched on a frame. The artist works from a\r\n              design, following <strong>37</strong>{\" \"}\r\n              <Input type=\"text\" className=\"w-32 mx-1 inline-block\" />{\" \"}\r\n              precisely, and uses a squeegee to press the ink through the mesh.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n              The process was first employed by the Chinese, who used human hair\r\n              to create the mesh. Today, the mesh is commercially produced.\r\n              Modern stencils are frequently created using photo-sensitive\r\n              gelatins but the stencil may also be cut by hand. Some artists\r\n              like to produce stencils with a <strong>38</strong>{\" \"}\r\n              <Input type=\"text\" className=\"w-32 mx-1 inline-block\" /> pattern,\r\n              but it is possible to produce all sorts of images. The screen can\r\n              be used repeatedly, so it is easy to print in several different\r\n              colors or to produce a large number of copies.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n              As well as thinking about the aesthetic impact of the printing\r\n              technique, artists also need to decide what surface to use. Many\r\n              like to use <strong>39</strong>{\" \"}\r\n              <Input type=\"text\" className=\"w-32 mx-1 inline-block\" /> but it is\r\n              also common to use card, plastic, or even <strong>40</strong>{\" \"}\r\n              <Input type=\"text\" className=\"w-32 mx-1 inline-block\" />.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>",
