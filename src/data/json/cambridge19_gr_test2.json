Despite its limited facilities, the site,\r\n              with its large tent pitches, is an ideal base for exploring the\r\n              area and driving to the rock museum, the craft workshops or Gaydon\r\n              Castle.

It only opened\r\n              last year, but already the website has some very positive reviews\r\n              from the handful of campers who know about it so far. It offers\r\n              splendid views over some of the country's most attractive beaches,\r\n              which can be accessed by steep, narrow cliff steps. You need a\r\n              good level of fitness for these, and don't forget to leave some\r\n              energy for the return trip at the end of the day.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            <h4 className=\"font-bold\">C Oakerly Estate</h4>\r\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\r\n              You won't be disappointed when you reach Oakerly, despite the\r\n              problems of getting there by car on such narrow roads. You'll see\r\n              quite a lot of motorhomes when you hit the clifftop, but there's\r\n              still plenty of room for tents on the spacious lawn that also\r\n              offers a camp kitchen, restaurant and bar. Make sure you stay safe\r\n              and pitch your tent within the white line around the cliff edge,\r\n              though.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            <h4 className=\"font-bold\">D South Turnbull</h4>\r\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\r\n              The emphasis at this site is on back-to-basics camping.

For those interested in the work, here is what a typical\r\n            day could be like for a trained care worker.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            Care workers often start early, as the first client of the day may\r\n            need help getting out of bed and putting on their clothes; they may\r\n            suffer from a condition that prevents them from doing this easily.\r\n            Providing these services helps clients to look and feel as good as\r\n            possible when beginning their day. The care worker may then help to\r\n            cook breakfast for the client, and this is often a good time to\r\n            enjoy a conversation and catch up on how they are feeling. Many\r\n            clients appreciate being able to chat to someone regularly, as some\r\n            may have no family members or friends living nearby. Next, the care\r\n            worker may take the opportunity to do some basic housework for the\r\n            client. Housework is often something that elderly people or people\r\n            with disabilities may not be able to do themselves. Even something\r\n            as simple as hoovering the living room can make a huge difference to\r\n            a client's day. Of course, there may be the breakfast dishes to do\r\n            as well.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            Later in the morning, the care worker may move on to another client\r\n            in order to help them prepare their midday meal. Care workers try to\r\n            ensure this is healthy because it is so important to keep clients\r\n            fit and well. When that's finished, the care worker may help the\r\n            client to carry out their shopping by going with them to the local\r\n            supermarket.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            During the afternoon, a care worker may help a third client with an\r\n            outdoor activity, which could involve going for a short walk in the\r\n            local area or taking the laundry to the launderette. Elderly people\r\n            may not feel confident going far on their own, so having company can\r\n            be a great help.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify\">\r\n            The care worker may participate in cooking dinner with their last\r\n            client and, before going home, they may also get out their client's\r\n            medication. This ensures the client remembers to take it before\r\n            going to bed.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"mb-8\">\r\n          <h3 className=\"font-bold mb-2\">\r\n            How to find a good balance between your work and your personal life\r\n          </h3>\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            A good work-life balance is beneficial to everyone. But how can it\r\n            be achieved? The first step is to take a serious look at the amount\r\n            of time you are devoting to work and set about reducing it. The main\r\n            benefit most people notice once they stop working too much is an\r\n            improvement in their general health and wellbeing.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <h4 className=\"font-bold\">Tips for a healthy work-life balance</h4>\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            A recent study showed office workers spend approximately 1,700 hours\r\n            a year in front of a computer. Ensure that your workstation is set\r\n            up so you're as comfortable as possible and this will help to\r\n            minimise the chance of any injuries.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            Whether it's making a hot drink, going for a walk or simply chatting\r\n            with a colleague, regular breaks are vital. Your brain needs a break\r\n            roughly every 90 minutes or concentration declines, leaving you with\r\n            difficulty focusing and feeling sleepy.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            Setting goals for both your professional and personal life is great.\r\n            Remember though, to make these realistic, because setting an\r\n            unattainable goal is the quickest way to damage your confidence.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            Activities such as sports and gymnastics are known to decrease\r\n            tension and increase endurance, two important factors towards\r\n            achieving a healthy work-life balance. They also boost your belief\r\n            that you can do whatever you are faced with.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            Sometimes it's easier said than done, but if you're juggling\r\n            numerous pieces of work on a daily basis, learning to prioritise is\r\n            key. Try to break down your work into various categories, depending\r\n            on how urgent and important each piece of work is. This will help\r\n            you to plan your day and achieve more.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            Ensure you have time to do the things that make you happy. If you've\r\n            got nothing nice to look forward to and can only see a long line of\r\n            work days ahead of you, this can easily become overwhelming and\r\n            ultimately hinder your productivity.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            It's there for a reason and there are no prizes for giving it up, so\r\n            make sure you take your annual holiday entitlement.

Only a few cities in the world, notably\r\n            Amsterdam, have managed to cut child obesity. As in Amsterdam, the\r\n            decline in Leeds is most marked among families living in the most\r\n            deprived areas, where the problem is worst and hardest to tackle.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            'The improvement in the most deprived children in Leeds is\r\n            startling,' said Susan Jebb, a professor of diet and population\r\n            health at Oxford University, whose team has analysed the city's\r\n            data. Over four years, obesity has dropped from 11.5% to 10.5% and\r\n            the trajectory is steadily downwards. Among the more affluent\r\n            families, there was also a decline from 6.8% to 6%. Overall the drop\r\n            was from 9.4% to 8.8%. The data comes from the national child\r\n            measurement programme (NCMP), which requires all children to be\r\n            weighed at the start and end of primary school. The biggest decline\r\n            in obesity in Leeds is 6.4% in the reception class, at about the age\r\n            of four.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            No such data has been reported elsewhere in the UK, where childhood\r\n            obesity is a major concern. The measurement programme shares the\r\n            progress made in each city with those considered comparable. For\r\n            Leeds, the 15 closest 'neighbours' at the start of its study period\r\n            in 2009 were Sheffield, Kirklees, Bristol, Newcastle upon Tyne,\r\n            Coventry, Bolton, Wakefield, Derby, Bradford, Dudley, Medway,\r\n            Liverpool, Swindon, County Durham and Warrington. The obesity rates\r\n            there and across the country have not shifted. Susan Jebb added that\r\n            the dropping rate in Leeds appeared to be a trend. 'This is four\r\n            years, not one rogue data point,' she said at the European Congress\r\n            on Obesity in Glasgow where she presented the research.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            Jebb, a former government adviser, says they cannot be sure what has\r\n            turned the tide in Leeds – but it could involve a programme called\r\n            'Henry' that the city introduced as the core of its obesity strategy\r\n            in 2009, focusing particularly on the youngest children and poorest\r\n            families. 'Henry' (Health, Exercise, Nutrition for the Really Young)\r\n            supports parents in setting boundaries for their children and taking\r\n            a positive stance on issues from healthy eating to bedtimes.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            'Henry's' chief executive, Kim Roberts, said the drop in obesity in\r\n            Leeds was 'unprecedented … The indicators are that this isn't\r\n            happening in other cities'. The programme encourages authoritative\r\n            rather than authoritarian parenting, she said. 'Authoritarian\r\n            parenting is when children are told what to eat and what to do, such\r\n            as being banned from leaving the table until they have eaten their\r\n            sprouts,' said Roberts. 'Permissive parenting is asking children\r\n            what they want to do. But 'Henry' encourages a third approach known\r\n            as authoritative parenting, where parents make it clear they are in\r\n            charge, but also respond to their children.' Instead of being asked\r\n            what vegetable they want with dinner, children might be asked\r\n            whether they would like carrots or broccoli. Instead of being told\r\n            to go to bed, they are asked where they want to read their story\r\n            beforehand.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify mb-4\">\r\n            Lisa, who joined a 'Henry' parenting course when her oldest daughter\r\n            was two, is enthusiastic about her family's experience of the\r\n            programme. She learned a lot about healthy eating, saved money by\r\n            planning meals and lost two stone herself. 'I think it made me a\r\n            better parent because of all the parenting skills stuff.

'Parents want to do the best for their children,' she\r\n            said. 'We wanted to focus on prevention because it's very, very\r\n            difficult when obesity has taken hold to tackle it. We understand\r\n            that there is no magic bullet here. Parents are experts in their own\r\n            lives, and they know what they can and can't achieve. The strategy\r\n            of 'Henry' is about sitting alongside parents and thinking through\r\n            what's right for them.'\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"text-justify\">\r\n            The public health minister, Seema Kennedy, was enthusiastic.
