There are 56\r\n          hill figures scattered around England, with the vast majority on the\r\n          chalk downlands of the southwest. The Uffington White Horse in\r\n          Oxfordshire is the most famous example. It lies on the Berkshire\r\n          Downs, a part of the North Wessex Downs, just below the Iron Age\r\n          hill-fort known as Uffington Castle and above a deep valley called the\r\n          Manger. The figure is formed from deep trenches filled with crushed\r\n          white chalk, and is presumed to represent a horse shown in profile,\r\n          although it has also been called a dragon.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          It was first documented in the 12th century and was previously thought\r\n          to have been constructed during the Iron Age (800 BCE-100 CE) or in\r\n          the early Anglo-Saxon period, but in 1995, the figure was dated by the\r\n          Oxford Archaeological Unit using a technique called optical stimulated\r\n          luminescence (OSL). OSL can be used to identify when the quartz\r\n          sediments were last exposed to sunlight. The results produced a date\r\n          range between 1400 and 600 BCE, putting it in the Late Bronze Age.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The figure has been maintained throughout its long history by periodic\r\n          scouring of the turf and chalk infill. This is known as the 'Scouring\r\n          of the White Horse', and was carried out at intervals of between 7 and\r\n          20 years. The cleaning process has always been a major local event\r\n          with a fair and various entertainments. Local records from 1763 refer\r\n          to a tradition of regular work on the figure, and a 'Pastime' festival\r\n          that accompanied it. The importance of cleaning the Horse was\r\n          emphasised when a thin layer of turf was allowed to grow over the\r\n          figure during World War II so that the location of the Horse could not\r\n          be used for navigation by enemy bombers. After the war, the withered\r\n          remains of the turf were cleared away and the Horse was resurfaced.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          There have been several well-documented scourings over the centuries.\r\n          For example, Francis Wise wrote in 1736: 'The ceremony of scouring the\r\n          Horse, from time immemorial, has been solemnized by a numerous\r\n          concourse of people from all the villages roundabout.' In 1780, a\r\n          newspaper reported details of the scouring and the traditional\r\n          festivities that accompanied it, including cheese rolling and\r\n          wrestling for a cake. In 2000, English Heritage took the unusual step\r\n          of commissioning a complete cleaning of the figure. The cleaning\r\n          process took several days. Specialist teams cleaned off all the\r\n          discolouration, slightly enlarged the figure to match more closely the\r\n          archaeological findings of the survey, and then re-chalked it using\r\n          160 tonnes of new chalk from a nearby mine. The reason for the\r\n          cleaning by English Heritage, apart from the historic tradition, is to\r\n          keep the chalk surface exposed, making it harder for plants to gain a\r\n          foothold, and therefore ensuring that the Horse remains clearly\r\n          visible from afar.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Many geoglyphs have been made in the last 300 years as memorials,\r\n          advertisements, or simply follies or jokes. The earliest were copies\r\n          of the Uffington White Horse and occurred within Berkshire itself, but\r\n          by the 1860s, new ones were being cut in Yorkshire and the southwest,\r\n          as well as in Berkshire. Most of the new geoglyphs are in the form of\r\n          horses. One of these is the Westbury White Horse, which has been\r\n          changed over the years. In the 1950s, the horse was painted over with\r\n          white concrete with the intention of reducing the need for future\r\n          maintenance. But the disadvantage of this kind of solid outline is\r\n          that weeds find it easier to grow in the cracks, and the edges become\r\n          blurred with the passage of time.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Other notable geoglyphs include the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset, and\r\n          the Long Man of Wilmington, Sussex. Experts are still debating whether\r\n          some of them are genuinely ancient, or were originally created in the\r\n          last 300-400 years. The majority of white horses date from the 18th\r\n          and 19th centuries. There was a fascination with the Uffington Horse,\r\n          and many villages wanted their own version. At least 24 of these white\r\n          horses are known to have existed. Wiltshire has the highest density of\r\n          white horses, with at least 13.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Not everyone approves of these 'modern' works, but the authorities\r\n          which control building and development works have been uneven in their\r\n          willingness to approve or to remove them. In Kent, for example, an\r\n          image of a horse cut by volunteers to mark the millennium was\r\n          criticised by conservation officers as a 'scar' on the countryside.\r\n          But early in 1999, the Army created one of the most interesting modern\r\n          geoglyphs, a kiwi, the emblem of New Zealand. A group of soldiers from\r\n          New Zealand, stationed in England, carved the image of the kiwi on\r\n          Beacon Hill above the military town of Bulford on the edge of\r\n          Salisbury Plain. Although it was not approved in advance, the Army has\r\n          decided to keep the kiwi and has even built steps to allow visitors to\r\n          view it.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Even though there is plenty of historical evidence for the ancient\r\n          origin of the Uffington Horse, many theories have been proposed to\r\n          explain the origin of the carving. Before the dating of the Uffington\r\n          Horse, it was generally believed that it was first created in the\r\n          Anglo-Saxon period (410-1066), but this is now known to be incorrect.\r\n          Among the range of ideas put forward, one writer even suggested that\r\n          the figure was not a horse or dragon, but a dog. However, almost all\r\n          researchers now accept that it is a horse – a horse seen from above.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          All the horse figures are somewhat stylised, and not proportioned like\r\n          real-life horses, but the Uffington carving is particularly abstract\r\n          and distant from literal representation. It is likely that it was\r\n          originally even more impressive than it appears today. First, when\r\n          freshly cut, it would have been visible from a much greater distance.\r\n          Its position on the steep slope would have emphasised the figure when\r\n          seen from below. This visual impact is especially important given that\r\n          the Horse is best viewed from directly opposite, rather than from\r\n          above. Secondly, the original carvers of the Horse would not have to\r\n          be concerned about making it anatomically correct; all they would have\r\n          needed to do was to produce a convincing impression, and they\r\n          certainly managed to do that.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      {/* READING PASSAGE 2 */}\r\n      <div className=\"mb-8\">\r\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4\">READING PASSAGE 2</h3>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 14-26</strong>,\r\n          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-2\">\r\n          Silbo Gomero – the whistle 'language' of the Canary Islands\r\n        </h4>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          La Gomera, one of the Canary Islands situated off the northwest coast\r\n          of Africa, is home to a remarkable cultural phenomenon: a whistled\r\n          'language' known as Silbo Gomero which is now enjoying a renewal of\r\n          interest. For centuries, the inhabitants of this small island have\r\n          communicated across the deep valleys and ravines that radiate out from\r\n          the island's central mountains by whistling to each other. This\r\n          whistling sound can travel up to 8 miles, much further than shouting,\r\n          and was used to pass messages and news between widely-separated\r\n          villages.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The origins of this whistled language are obscure. There is general\r\n          agreement that it existed before the arrival of the Spanish, who\r\n          conquered the Canary Islands in the 15th century. The original\r\n          inhabitants of the islands were the Guanches, a group of white-skinned\r\n          people related to the North African Berbers. Some researchers have\r\n          claimed that the whistle language was also used in other parts of\r\n          Berber North Africa, supporting the theory of its ancient origins.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The Spanish conquerors took only 80 years to wipe out the original\r\n          Guanche language and enforce the use of Spanish. Remarkably, though,\r\n          the Guanches' whistle language survived, by being adapted to Spanish.\r\n          It was widely used throughout the island until the 1950s, when a range\r\n          of economic and social factors began to endanger its survival. Many\r\n          Gomerans were forced by drought and economic hardship to emigrate to\r\n          Venezuela and other Latin American countries. Others moved to nearby\r\n          Tenerife, or shifted to the island's main town, San Sebastian, in\r\n          search of work. Road building, the spread of telephone networks, and\r\n          transistor radios all contributed to its decline. Once a feature of\r\n          daily life, increasingly it was only in remote areas and among the\r\n          elderly that silbadores (whistlers) could be found.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The language of Silbo Gomero has survived in the form in which we find\r\n          it today largely because of the creation of schools for Silbo in the\r\n          1990s. In 1997, Silbo Gomero came to the attention of Dr Ramon\r\n          Trujillo of the University of La Laguna in Tenerife. His subsequent\r\n          studies emphasised that Silbo was a complex whistled language that\r\n          could convey any message, not simply a set of signals with a limited\r\n          range of meanings, like military bugle calls, for example. A language\r\n          which enables a vocabulary of more than 500 words to be whistled\r\n          clearly and understood is a remarkable achievement. Following this\r\n          research, the island government, El Cabildo Insular de la Gomera,\r\n          launched a campaign to save Silbo Gomero from extinction and preserve\r\n          this unique cultural treasure.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          In 1999, Silbo Gomero was introduced as a compulsory subject in\r\n          primary schools throughout the island. Since then, it has been taught\r\n          to over 3,000 children, although it is not clear how many have\r\n          persevered and become proficient whistlers; research has shown that it\r\n          takes about two years to speak Silbo well. This revival, together with\r\n          the development of tourism in the Canary Islands, means that most\r\n          Gomerans now regard Silbo as a matter of pride, not shame. A whistling\r\n          demonstration is a regular part of the floor show in restaurants, and\r\n          competitions and championships are held each year. In 2009, the\r\n          language was placed on the UNESCO Representative List of the\r\n          Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          How does 'speaking' by whistling work? Normal human speech uses a\r\n          combination of vowel sounds, created by the vocal cords and modified\r\n          by the tongue and soft palate, and consonants made by restricting\r\n          airflow with the tongue or lips etc. In order to cover adequate ranges\r\n          of these very different types of sound, whistling uses a simple but\r\n          effective substitution. The four vowels of Spanish become just two\r\n          whistled vowels, and the range of consonants is correspondingly\r\n          reduced, although not quite so drastically. A crucial feature of\r\n          Silbo's effectiveness is that, when whistled, very different Spanish\r\n          words sound identical. The word for 'house' (casa) sounds the same as\r\n          the word for 'hunting' (caza), for example. In practice, however, this\r\n          is not a problem as the context of the conversation usually makes it\r\n          quite clear which meaning is intended.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Dr Michelle Cuskley, a researcher, wanted to see just how well\r\n          first-time listeners with no previous experience of Silbo could\r\n          understand it. She presented 39 Spaniards from Madrid with recordings\r\n          of silbadores whistling 215 Spanish sentences. Results were variable,\r\n          with some subjects guessing the meaning correctly quite often, while\r\n          others struggled. A score of 38.6% accuracy for those subjects hearing\r\n          Silbo for the first time is quite impressive, suggests Dr. Cuskley.\r\n          Intelligibility to the uninitiated is a key difference between Silbo\r\n          Gomero and the many other non-spoken forms of language that exist\r\n          today. For example, when subjects were tested on their ability to\r\n          understand American Sign Language (ASL), they only scored 25% for\r\n          intelligibility. Even after some basic training in ASL, this only rose\r\n          to 33.6%, comparable to a complete novice's understanding of Silbo.\r\n          Yet with some guidance and practice, they can learn to recognize words\r\n          even on a first encounter.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          There are more than 70 other whistled languages still in use in remote\r\n          and mountainous areas throughout the world, including Turkey, Mexico,\r\n          Greece and China. None of these have the size or status of Silbo\r\n          Gomero, and none have achieved the recognition it now enjoys. But in\r\n          most of the places where these languages survive, their long-term\r\n          future is uncertain. In Kuskoy, Turkey, the next most famous whistled\r\n          language community, many young people are not learning to whistle.\r\n          There is now a similar risk for Silbo Gomero. Although children are\r\n          learning it at school, they then have few opportunities to practice it\r\n          or use it in context, and as a result, not many of them continue to do\r\n          so. This, coupled with its declining everyday use for communication,\r\n          inevitably means that the skill level is gradually deteriorating.\r\n          Nevertheless, the rapid progress in revival and protection provides\r\n          some hope for the long-term future of whistling languages.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      {/* READING PASSAGE 3 */}\r\n      <div className=\"mb-8\">\r\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4\">READING PASSAGE 3</h3>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>,\r\n          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-2\">The importance of children's play</h4>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Brick by brick, six-year-old Alice is building a magical kingdom.\r\n          Imagining fairy-tale turrets and fire-breathing dragons, wicked\r\n          witches and gallant heroes, she's creating an enchanting world.\r\n          Although she isn't aware of it, this fantasy is helping her take her\r\n          first steps towards her capacity for creativity and so it will have\r\n          important repercussions in her adult life.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Minutes later, Alice has abandoned the kingdom in favour of playing\r\n          schools with her younger brother. When she bosses him around as his\r\n          'teacher', she's practicing how to regulate her emotions through\r\n          pretence. Later on, when they tire of this and settle down with a\r\n          board game, she's learning about the need to follow rules and take\r\n          turns with a partner.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          'Play in all its rich variety is one of the highest achievements of\r\n          the human species,' says Dr. David Whitebread from the Faculty of\r\n          Education at the University of Cambridge, UK. 'It underpins how we\r\n          develop as intellectual, problem-solving adults and is crucial to our\r\n          success as a highly adaptable species.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Recognising the importance of play is not new: over two millennia ago,\r\n          the Greek philosopher Plato extolled its virtues as a means of\r\n          developing skills for adult life, and ideas about play-based learning\r\n          have been developing since the 19th century.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          But we live in changing times, and Whitebread is mindful of a\r\n          worldwide decline in play, pointing out that over half the people in\r\n          the world now live in cities. 'The opportunities for free play, which\r\n          I experienced almost every day of my childhood, are becoming\r\n          increasingly scarce,' he says. Outdoor play is curtailed by\r\n          perceptions of risk to do with traffic, as well as parents' increased\r\n          wish to protect their children from being the victims of crime, and by\r\n          the emphasis on 'earlier is better' which is leading to greater\r\n          competition in academic learning and schools being judged by test\r\n          results. International bodies like the United Nations and the European\r\n          Union have begun to develop policies concerned with children's right\r\n          to play, and to consider implications for leisure facilities and\r\n          educational programmes.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          But what they don't always understand is the potential of play in\r\n          schools. 'For many children, playing and learning are not separate\r\n          activities at all,' says Whitebread. In a study carried out by his\r\n          colleague, researcher Marisol Basilio, over 800 primary-school\r\n          teachers were asked what they thought children learned through play:\r\n          many mentioned social skills, but 'strikingly, many did not appreciate\r\n          the contribution that play makes to children's cognitive development\r\n          in particular'.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Whitebread's research team at the PEDAL Centre, which he directs, have\r\n          been providing evidence to fill in the gaps in our understanding of\r\n          the importance of play in the development of qualities such as\r\n          independence and creativity. 'A strong possibility is that play\r\n          supports the early development of children's self control,' explains\r\n          Dr. Emily Farran, also of the Faculty of Education. 'This is our\r\n          ability to develop awareness of our own thinking processes – it\r\n          influences how effectively we go about undertaking challenging\r\n          activities.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          In a study carried out by Whitebread's colleague, researcher Marisol\r\n          Basilio, children were given puzzles to complete under two conditions:\r\n          they could ask for help, or they had to play with a puzzle first. The\r\n          results revealed that children who were encouraged to play with the\r\n          puzzle first did better on the puzzles, performed better on subsequent\r\n          assessments taken on their own, and were less reliant on asking for\r\n          help from adults. In other words, children developed better cognitive\r\n          skills when they had played.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Children are more likely to be aware of their own thought processes,\r\n          and become more effective, independent learners, if teachers engage\r\n          with their children in playful ways, rather than direct teaching. The\r\n          traditional role is to teach, but researchers at the PEDAL Centre\r\n          disagree. 'It may be that we need to consider other roles: partner,\r\n          guide, mentor,' says Whitebread. 'Understanding that play is a way\r\n          children learn – without being \"taught\" – is a research challenge for\r\n          the 21st century.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Beyond the immediate question of how best to help children learn,\r\n          there's the related question of how the quality of childhood affects\r\n          physical and mental health later on. Professor Alison Gopnik, author\r\n          of The Gardener and the Carpenter, told the audience at the PEDAL\r\n          Centre's launch that children's play is evolution's answer to the\r\n          uncertainty of the future, an adaptive strategy enabling flexible\r\n          responses to the environment, not based on genes alone.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The PEDAL Centre is also advancing research work on the role of play\r\n          in preparing for uncertainty and coping with stress. Extending the\r\n          ways children learn through play to include the classroom brings a new\r\n          set of challenges. Parents and policy makers tend to favour\r\n          traditional approaches, especially when national and international\r\n          benchmarking systems for measuring achievements in literacy, maths and\r\n          science are so visible.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The research being done at the PEDAL Centre takes on the challenge of\r\n          playing the long game: proving the importance of play in strengthening\r\n          mental and physical health, in developing resilience in a constantly\r\n          evolving world, and in transforming the quality of childhood.\r\n          Whitebread's team hope that their work will improve the intellectual\r\n          architecture of the minds of future generations, and that the study of\r\n          play will earn its own place on the timetable of life.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          'Rather than seeing play as something trivial, we should recognise it\r\n          as highly evolved and deeply important. Early human life is set up for\r\n          maximum play, exploration and learning. Starting school doesn't mean\r\n          that children should all of a sudden stop playing: quite the\r\n          opposite,' says Gopnik.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>",
