Maximise visibility by attaching reflector\r\n            strips to the back and front of the bike, helmet, arms, legs and\r\n            shoes. Children twelve years and over have to follow the same road\r\n            rules as adults.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-1\">Cycling offences</h4>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            If you break cycling rules you will be fined.

When senior police\r\n            officers are asked to name the most foolish cycling behaviour, they\r\n            all agree that cycling without a helmet causes the most serious\r\n            injuries.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <Separator className=\"my-6\" />\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 font-medium\">\r\n          Read the text below and answer Questions 8–14.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"passage\">\r\n          <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-2\">\r\n            Campus Health Orientations and Health Insurance at Graybridge\r\n            University\r\n          </h3>\r\n\r\n          <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-1\">\r\n            Campus Health orientations for international students\r\n          </h4>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            International students registered in courses at the university need\r\n            to attend a Campus Health orientation session. During the\r\n            orientation session, students will learn about the range of services\r\n            we provide at Campus Health, how to access these services and how to\r\n            access health care in Australia more generally. It is important that\r\n            international students have information about the local health\r\n            system; for example, many students may be unaware that Australian\r\n            universities do not have doctors on campus.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-1\">Health insurance</h4>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            According to the rules of the university, all international students\r\n            are required to have health insurance for the entire period of their\r\n            studies. The university has an agreement with International Care\r\n            Cover, which specialises in health insurance plans for international\r\n            students in Australia. During the orientation, therefore, students\r\n            will also learn how to use their International Care Cover policy to\r\n            cover medical expenses during their study period.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-1\">Graybridge international students</h4>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            Prior to arrival at Graybridge, the International Care Cover policy\r\n            will have been arranged for each student and the cost added to their\r\n            university fees. If students arrive outside office hours, they\r\n            should report to the International Student Centre (ISC) on the next\r\n            business day.

Online bookings for\r\n            services cannot be made at Campus Health as each student's\r\n            eligibility for services needs to be verified.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            Students should not wait until they are sick to contact Campus\r\n            Health.

Most appointments are available\r\n            free of charge for international students covered by International\r\n            Care Cover. Health service fees for appointments with a specialist\r\n            are payable by the student at the time of the appointment and can\r\n            then be reimbursed by International Care Cover.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            Students should arrive promptly for their appointments.

For this, it is\r\n            important to meet and speak to the individual or team who requested\r\n            the training. For example, if you are designing a programme that\r\n            instructs staff on how to use a company induction manual, it is\r\n            important to learn who the induction manual is written for and in\r\n            what context it is going to be used. Talk to those who made the\r\n            request and try to anticipate issues that might arise. This can save\r\n            time and resources. Discuss details such as what the employees are\r\n            doing now and what they should be able to do after the training.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-1\">Step 2: Map out the stages</h4>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            When writing down the stages of your programme, start by outlining\r\n            the main aims and then break these down into smaller steps. For\r\n            example, if the aim is to teach staff how to organise a meeting from\r\n            start to finish, you might include steps like: 'prepare an agenda,\r\n            book a venue, ensure the right people attend'. When deciding the\r\n            order of the steps, it can be useful to arrange the programme\r\n            chronologically, starting with what needs to be done first.\r\n            Alternatively, you can structure the programme around competence\r\n            levels (from simple to complex actions), to build the confidence of\r\n            the training participants.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-1\">Step 3: Get feedback</h4>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            Consulting as many people as possible before delivering the\r\n            programme can prevent expensive errors. You can discuss the content\r\n            with experts on the subject, with future participants, or with\r\n            potential users such as a participant's manager.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-1\">\r\n            Step 4: Choose appropriate training methods\r\n          </h4>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            The most effective way to structure the programme is to combine\r\n            various types of activities, including, for example, mini-lectures\r\n            or handouts, followed by discussions and exercises that allow\r\n            participants to relate the information to their own experience.\r\n            Participants benefit not only from the trainer's expertise, but also\r\n            from the shared knowledge and experience of other participants.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            For a programme to be useful to participants, however, it must\r\n            relate to the real world. Thus, role-plays, simulations, and team\r\n            activities should be based on realistic working environments.\r\n            Trainers can ask participants to bring examples of relevant\r\n            documents or issues from their own workplace, which can serve as\r\n            examples for practical activities.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            Finally, you need to write down the final programme.

It has taken decades\r\n            for governments to accept that climate change is happening, largely\r\n            because vested interests with huge financial resources have been\r\n            effective in swaying public opinion. In contrast, a very active\r\n            environmental campaigning movement has emerged since the middle of\r\n            the twentieth century. This has raised awareness and gradually\r\n            gained increasing influence on key decision-makers.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            <strong>B</strong> From the 1990s onwards, however, the campaigns\r\n            and media messages coming from the environmental movement have\r\n            increasingly been criticised for their overly negative tone and for\r\n            creating 'climate fatigue'. By constantly focusing on large-scale\r\n            disasters and extreme weather, but offering no realistic strategies\r\n            beyond urgent demands for governments to ban fossil fuels,\r\n            environmental campaigns have been accused of failing to engage the\r\n            public, and even of alienating those who might otherwise be\r\n            supporters. As a result, there have been widespread calls for more\r\n            emotionally balanced messaging and, in particular, for offering\r\n            people concrete suggestions on how they can be part of the solution.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            <strong>C</strong> Early writers on environmental communication,\r\n            such as Peter Sandman, suggested that where there was urgent need\r\n            for action, the most effective strategy for engaging the public was\r\n            to make them feel 'appropriately scared'. But research has since\r\n            shown that too much fear can create a defensive emotional reaction\r\n            in people, which can result in their feeling helpless or ignoring or\r\n            denying the risk. More recently, environmental campaigners have\r\n            argued that making people feel guilty or fearful can demoralise\r\n            them, and that it would be better to find more 'emotionally\r\n            balanced' ways of engaging with them. In particular, they propose a\r\n            greater emphasis on solutions and the potential for positive change,\r\n            drawing on more recent research, which indicates that seeing\r\n            practical solutions lessens negative feelings about environmental\r\n            problems.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            <strong>D</strong> Recently, a number of environmental organisations\r\n            have revised their communications strategies to incorporate these\r\n            ideas. For example, in the UK, a group called the Climate Coalition\r\n            has emphasised the positive things people care about that could be\r\n            affected by climate change. And in the US, the Environmental Defence\r\n            Fund has started setting out solutions to climate change, rather\r\n            than simply saying what the problem is. Meanwhile, in many countries\r\n            there has been a growth in local environmental groups engaged in\r\n            activities such as community gardens for food growing, or care and\r\n            protection of natural environments. These focus on practical\r\n            activities that can benefit both the environment and the communities\r\n            concerned. Engaging with these groups can connect people to nature\r\n            in their own local area.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            <strong>E</strong> On the other hand, George Marshall from the\r\n            Climate Outreach and Information Network has criticised what he sees\r\n            as the overemphasis by environmental organisations on presenting\r\n            rational arguments, believing this to be motivated by a false\r\n            assumption that people are rational. Certainly, it is clear that\r\n            attitudes towards environmental issues are affected by people's\r\n            cultural values and beliefs: someone with a strongly individualistic\r\n            worldview, for example, may be less receptive to messages about the\r\n            importance of regulating business. In some parts of the world,\r\n            climate change is seen as a political rather than a scientific\r\n            issue. Different views on this issue can also lead to people\r\n            ignoring or dismissing scientific information, or rejecting policies\r\n            because they are seen to represent the views of opposing political\r\n            perspectives. Because of this, environmental campaigners\r\n            increasingly recognise the need to listen to and use the language of\r\n            those whose minds they are trying to change.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            <strong>F</strong> However, Pat Dade, of the cultural values mapping\r\n            company Cultural Dynamics, believes many environmental campaigns and\r\n            messages are still based on guilt. One of the main problems with\r\n            guilt as an emotion is that creating it depends on a moralising\r\n            approach – implying that some actions are right while others are\r\n            wrong. And people who are told they are doing something 'wrong' tend\r\n            to feel judged and criticised, and to respond defensively. This is\r\n            why a more positive approach is often most effective. People in\r\n            general have a range of psychological needs, such as feeling that\r\n            they can decide their own destiny, that there is meaning in what\r\n            they do, and that they are connected to others. Where environmental\r\n            campaigners can show that protecting the environment also offers a\r\n            way of meeting those needs, it is likely that more people will\r\n            respond positively.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            <strong>G</strong> So, what kind of approach would the evidence\r\n            suggest is likely to be most successful? A group of UK\r\n            government-funded researchers has proposed a set of principles for\r\n            effective environmental communication. It advises environmental\r\n            campaigners to understand what matters to their audiences, and to\r\n            show how environmental protection can deliver those things for them.\r\n            It encourages communicators to make sure they live by the advice\r\n            they give to others, but at the same time to avoid creating a new\r\n            moral code that judges those who do not conform. It also stresses\r\n            that environmental campaigns need to show that they understand the\r\n            pressures that modern living places on people, and to use language\r\n            and ideas that reflect shared values (for example, the concept of\r\n            'wastefulness').\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n            <strong>H</strong> Above all, this approach suggests that people\r\n            need both information and empowerment: they need to have their\r\n            intelligence treated with respect but also to be given realistic\r\n            strategies through which they can implement change. No wonder fear\r\n            and guilt are counterproductive. The important principle is creating\r\n            confidence that the environmental challenges facing the world can be\r\n            addressed. Fear can create a sense of urgency, but effective\r\n            communication about environmental threats such as climate change\r\n            needs to be coupled with confidence that there are things that can\r\n            be done, individually and collectively, to avert potential disaster.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>",
