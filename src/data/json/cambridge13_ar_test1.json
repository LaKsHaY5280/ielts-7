Tourism currently makes up 9% of the country's gross domestic\r\n          product, and is the country's largest export sector. Unlike other\r\n          export sectors, which make products and then sell them overseas,\r\n          tourism brings its customers to New Zealand. The product is the\r\n          country itself – the people, the places and the experiences. In 1999,\r\n          Tourism New Zealand launched a campaign to communicate a new brand\r\n          position to the world. The campaign focused on New Zealand's scenic\r\n          beauty, exhilarating outdoor activities and authentic Maori culture,\r\n          and it made New Zealand one of the strongest national brands in the\r\n          world.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          A key feature of the campaign was the website www.newzealand.com,\r\n          which provided potential visitors to New Zealand with a single gateway\r\n          to everything the destination had to offer. The heart of the website\r\n          was a database of tourism services operators, both those based in New\r\n          Zealand and those based abroad which offered tourism service to the\r\n          country. Any tourism-related business could be listed by filling in a\r\n          simple form. This meant that even the smallest bed and breakfast\r\n          address or specialist activity provider could gain a web presence with\r\n          access to an audience of long-haul visitors. In addition, because\r\n          participating businesses were able to update the details they gave on\r\n          a regular basis, the information provided remained accurate. And to\r\n          maintain and improve standards, Tourism New Zealand organised a scheme\r\n          whereby organisations appearing on the website underwent an\r\n          independent evaluation against a set of agreed national standards of\r\n          quality. As part of this, the effect of each business on the\r\n          environment was considered.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          To communicate the New Zealand experience, the site also carried\r\n          features relating to famous people and places. One of the most popular\r\n          was an interview with former New Zealand All Blacks rugby captain Tana\r\n          Umaga. Another feature that attracted a lot of attention was an\r\n          interactive journey through a number of the locations chosen for\r\n          blockbuster films which had made use of New Zealand's stunning scenery\r\n          as a backdrop. As the site developed, additional features were added\r\n          to help independent travelers devise their own customised itineraries.\r\n          To make it easier to plan motoring holidays, the site catalogued the\r\n          most popular driving routes in the country, highlighting different\r\n          routes according to the season and indicating distances and times.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Later, a Travel Planner feature was added, which allowed visitors to\r\n          click and 'bookmark' places or attractions they were interested in,\r\n          and then view the results on a map. The Travel Planner offered\r\n          suggested routes and public transport options between the chosen\r\n          locations. There were also links to accommodation in the area. By\r\n          registering with the website, users could save their Travel Plan and\r\n          return to it later, or print it out to take on the visit. The website\r\n          also had a 'Your Words' section where anyone could submit a blog of\r\n          their New Zealand travels for possible inclusion on the website.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The Tourism New Zealand website won two Webby awards for online\r\n          achievement and innovation. More importantly perhaps, the growth of\r\n          tourism to New Zealand was impressive. Overall tourism expenditure\r\n          increased by an average of 6.9% per year between 1999 and 2004. From\r\n          Britain, visits to New Zealand grew at an average annual rate of 13%\r\n          between 2002 and 2006, compared to a rate of 4% overall for British\r\n          visits abroad.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The website was set up to allow both individuals and travel\r\n          organisations to create itineraries and travel packages to suit their\r\n          own needs and interests. On the website, visitors can search for\r\n          activities not solely by geographical location, but also by the\r\n          particular nature of the activity. This is important as research shows\r\n          that activities are the key driver of visitor satisfaction,\r\n          contributing 74% to visitor satisfaction, while transport and\r\n          accommodation account for the remaining 26%. The more activities that\r\n          visitors undertake, the more satisfied they will be. It has also been\r\n          found that visitors enjoy cultural activities most when they are\r\n          interactive, such as visiting a <em>marae</em> (meeting ground) to\r\n          learn about traditional Maori life. Many long-haul travelers enjoy\r\n          such learning experiences, which provide them with stories to take\r\n          home to their friends and family. In addition, it appears that\r\n          visitors to New Zealand don't want to be 'one of the crowd' and find\r\n          activities that involve only a few people more special and meaningful.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          It could be argued that New Zealand is not a typical destination. New\r\n          Zealand is a small country with a visitor economy composed mainly of\r\n          small businesses. It is generally perceived as a safe English-speaking\r\n          country with a reliable transport infrastructure. Because of the\r\n          long-haul flight, most visitors stay for longer (average 20 days) and\r\n          want to see as much of the country as possible on what is often seen\r\n          as a once-in-a-lifetime visit. However, the underlying lessons apply\r\n          anywhere – the effectiveness of a strong brand, a strategy based on\r\n          unique experiences and a comprehensive and user-friendly website.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h2 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4 mt-8\">READING PASSAGE 2</h2>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 14-26</strong>{\" \"}\r\n          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3 className=\"font-bold mb-2\">\r\n          Why being bored is stimulating – and useful, too\r\n        </h3>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"italic mb-4\">\r\n          This most common of emotions is turning out to be more interesting\r\n          than we thought\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">A</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          We all know how it feels – it's impossible to keep your mind on\r\n          anything, time stretches out, and all the things you could do seem\r\n          equally unlikely to make you feel better. But defining boredom so that\r\n          it can be studied in the lab has proved difficult. For a start, it can\r\n          include a lot of other mental states, such as frustration, apathy,\r\n          depression and indifference. There isn't even agreement over whether\r\n          boredom is always a low-energy, flat kind of emotion or whether\r\n          feeling agitated and restless counts as boredom, too. In his book,{\" \"}\r\n          <em>Boredom: A Lively History</em>, Peter Toohey at the University of\r\n          Calgary, Canada, compares it to disgust – an emotion that motivates us\r\n          to stay away from certain situations. 'If disgust protects humans from\r\n          infection, boredom may protect them from \"infectious\" social\r\n          situations,' he suggests.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">B</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          By asking people about their experiences of boredom, Thomas Goetz and\r\n          his team at the University of Konstanz in Germany have recently\r\n          identified five distinct types: indifferent, calibrating, searching,\r\n          reactant and apathetic. These can be plotted on two axes – one running\r\n          left to right, which measures low to high arousal, and the other from\r\n          top to bottom, which measures how positive or negative the feeling is.\r\n          Intriguingly, Goetz has found that while people experience all kinds\r\n          of boredom, they tend to specialise in one. Of the five types, the\r\n          most damaging is 'reactant' boredom with its explosive combination of\r\n          high arousal and negative emotion. The most useful is what Goetz calls\r\n          'indifferent' boredom: someone isn't engaged in anything satisfying\r\n          but still feels relaxed and calm. However, it remains to be seen\r\n          whether there are any character traits that predict the kind of\r\n          boredom each of us might be prone to.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">C</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Psychologist Sandi Mann at the University of Central Lancashire, UK,\r\n          goes further. 'All emotions are there for a reason, including\r\n          boredom,' she says. Mann has found that being bored makes us more\r\n          creative. 'We're all afraid of being bored but in actual fact it can\r\n          lead to all kinds of amazing things,' she says. In experiments\r\n          published last year, Mann found that people who had been made to feel\r\n          bored by copying numbers out of the phone book for 15 minutes came up\r\n          with more creative ideas about how to use a polystyrene cup than a\r\n          control group. Mann concluded that a passive, boring activity is best\r\n          for creativity because it allows the mind to wander. In fact, she goes\r\n          so far as to suggest that we should seek out more boredom in our\r\n          lives.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">D</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Psychologist John Eastwood at York University in Toronto, Canada,\r\n          isn't convinced. 'If you are in a state of mind-wandering you are not\r\n          bored,' he says. 'In my view, by definition boredom is an undesirable\r\n          state.' That doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't adaptive, he adds.\r\n          'Pain is adaptive – if we didn't have physical pain, bad things would\r\n          happen to us. Does that mean that we should actively cause pain? No.\r\n          But even if boredom has evolved to help us survive, it can still be\r\n          toxic if allowed to fester.' For Eastwood, the central feature of\r\n          boredom is a failure to put our 'attention system' into gear. This\r\n          causes an inability to focus on anything, which makes time seem to go\r\n          painfully slowly. What's more, your efforts to improve the situation\r\n          can end up making you feel worse. 'People try to connect with the\r\n          world and if they are not successful there's that frustration and\r\n          irritability,' he says. Perhaps most worryingly, says Eastwood,\r\n          repeatedly failing to engage attention can lead to state where we\r\n          don't know what to do any more, and no longer care.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">E</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Eastwood's team is now trying to explore why the attention system\r\n          fails. It's early days but they think that at least some of it comes\r\n          down to personality. Boredom proneness has been linked with a variety\r\n          of traits. People who are motivated by pleasure seem to suffer\r\n          particularly badly. Other personality traits, such as curiosity, are\r\n          associated with a high boredom threshold. More evidence that boredom\r\n          has detrimental effects comes from studies of people who are more or\r\n          less prone to boredom. It seems those who bore easily face poorer\r\n          prospects in education, their career and even life in general. But of\r\n          course, boredom itself cannot kill – it's the things we do to deal\r\n          with it that may put us in danger. What can we do to alleviate it\r\n          before it comes to that? Goetz's group has one suggestion. Working\r\n          with teenagers, they found that those who 'approach' a boring\r\n          situation – in other words, see that it's boring and get stuck in\r\n          anyway – report less boredom than those who try to avoid it by using\r\n          snacks, TV or social media for distraction.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">F</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Psychologist Francoise Wemelsfelder speculates that our over-connected\r\n          lifestyles might even be a new source of boredom. 'In modern human\r\n          society there is a lot of overstimulation but still a lot of problems\r\n          finding meaning,' she says. So instead of seeking yet more mental\r\n          stimulation, perhaps we should leave our phones alone, and use boredom\r\n          to motivate us to engage with the world in a more meaningful way.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h2 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4 mt-8\">READING PASSAGE 3</h2>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>{\" \"}\r\n          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3 className=\"font-bold mb-2\">Artificial artist?</h3>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"italic mb-4\">Can computers really create works of art?</p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The Painting Fool is one of a growing number of computer programs\r\n          which, so their makers claim, possess creative talents. Classical\r\n          music by an artificial composer has had audiences enraptured, and even\r\n          tricked them into believing a human was behind the score. Artworks\r\n          painted by a robot have sold for thousands of dollars and been hung in\r\n          prestigious galleries. And software has been built which creates are\r\n          that could not have been imagined by the programmer.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Human beings are the only species to perform sophisticated creative\r\n          acts regularly. If we can break this process down into computer code,\r\n          where does that leave human creativity? 'This is a question at the\r\n          very core of humanity,' says Geraint Wiggins, a computational\r\n          creativity researcher at Goldsmiths, University of London. 'It scares\r\n          a lot of people. They are worried that it is taking something special\r\n          away from what it means to be human.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          To some extent, we are all familiar with computerised art. The\r\n          question is: where does the work of the artist stop and the creativity\r\n          of the computer begin? Consider one of the oldest machine artists,\r\n          Aaron, a robot that has had paintings exhibited in London's Tate\r\n          Modern and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Aaron can pick up a\r\n          paintbrush and paint on canvas on its own. Impressive perhaps, but it\r\n          is still little more than a tool to realise the programmer's own\r\n          creative ideas.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Simon Colton, the designer of the Painting Fool, is keen to make sure\r\n          his creation doesn't attract the same criticism. Unlike earlier\r\n          'artists' such as Aaron, the Painting Fool only needs minimal\r\n          direction and can come up with its own concepts by going online for\r\n          material. The software runs its own web searches and trawls through\r\n          social media sites. It is now beginning to display a kind of\r\n          imagination too, creating pictures from scratch. One of its original\r\n          works is a series of fuzzy landscapes, depicting trees and sky. While\r\n          some might say they have a mechanical look, Colton argues that such\r\n          reactions arise from people's double standards towards\r\n          software-produced and human-produced art. After all, he says, consider\r\n          that the Painting Fool painted the landscapes without referring to a\r\n          photo. 'If a child painted a new scene from its head, you'd say it has\r\n          a certain level of imagination,' he points out. 'The same should be\r\n          true of a machine.' Software bugs can also lead to unexpected results.\r\n          Some of the Painting Fool's paintings of a chair came out in black and\r\n          white, thanks to a technical glitch. This gives the work an eerie,\r\n          ghostlike quality. Human artists like the renowned Ellsworth Kelly are\r\n          lauded for limiting their colour palette – so why should computers be\r\n          any different?\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Researchers like Colton don't believe it is right to measure machine\r\n          creativity directly to that of humans who 'have had millennia to\r\n          develop our skills'. Others, though, are fascinated by the prospect\r\n          that a computer might create something as original and subtle as our\r\n          best artists. So far, only one has come close. Composer David Cope\r\n          invented a program called Experiments in Musical Intelligence, or EMI.\r\n          Not only did EMI create compositions in Cope's style, but also that of\r\n          the most revered classical composers, including Bach, Chopin and\r\n          Mozart. Audiences were moved to tears, and EMI even fooled classical\r\n          music experts into thinking they were hearing genuine Bach. Not\r\n          everyone was impressed however. Some, such as Wiggins, have blasted\r\n          Cope's work as pseudoscience, and condemned him for his deliberately\r\n          vague explanation of how the software worked. Meanwhile, Douglas\r\n          Hofstadter of Indiana University said EMI created replicas which still\r\n          rely completely on the original artist's creative impulses. When\r\n          audiences found out the truth they were often outraged with Cope, and\r\n          one music lover even tried to punch him. Amid such controversy, Cope\r\n          destroyed EMI's vital databases.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          But why did so many people love the music, yet recoil when the\r\n          discovered how it was composed? A study by computer scientist David\r\n          Moffat of Glasgow Caledonian University provides a clue. He asked both\r\n          expert musicians and non-experts to assess six compositions. The\r\n          participants weren't told beforehand whether the tunes were composed\r\n          by humans or computers, but were asked to guess, and then rate how\r\n          much they liked each one. People who thought the composer was a\r\n          computer tended to dislike the piece more than those who believed it\r\n          was human. This was true even among the experts, who might have been\r\n          expected to be more objective in their analyses.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Where does this prejudice come from? Paul Bloom of Yale University has\r\n          a suggestion: he reckons part of the pleasure we get from art stems\r\n          from the creative process behind the work. This can give it an\r\n          'irresistible essence', says Bloom. Meanwhile, experiments by Justin\r\n          Kruger of New York University have shown that people's enjoyment of an\r\n          artwork increases if they think more time and effort was needed to\r\n          create it. Similarly, Colton thinks that when people experience art,\r\n          they wonder what the artist might have been thinking or what the\r\n          artist is trying to tell them. It seems obvious, therefore, that with\r\n          computers producing art, this speculation is cut short – there's\r\n          nothing to explore.
