It is important to\r\n          take all reasonably practicable measure to keep customers and yourself\r\n          incident and injury free.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          <strong>Biohazard waste</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Plumbers regularly come into contact with biohazard waste. It's the\r\n          nature of the job, but that doesn't mean you should be complacent\r\n          about it. According to Safe Work Australia, communicable diseases from\r\n          work-related exposures to biological hazards such as sewage have been\r\n          estimated to cause 320,000 deaths across the globe each year. In\r\n          addition to this, plumbers are regularly exposed to other biohazards\r\n          such as mould, bacteria and algae. Don't risk it – make sure\r\n          appropriate clothing and equipment is used.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          <strong>Confined spaces</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Plumbers may spend much of their time working in confined spaces,\r\n          where they are at risk from contaminants, including airborne gases,\r\n          vapours and dusts, that may cause injury from fire or explosion. They\r\n          may also be exposed to high concentration of airborne contaminants\r\n          that may be harmful to health. For example, one plumber was fined\r\n          $220,000 after an employee suffered from carbon-monoxide poisoning.\r\n          Another potential hazard for plumbers in confined spaces is that of\r\n          drowning, if water sources are not adequately cut off.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The Safe Work Australia confined spaces code of practice outlines the\r\n          necessary steps and precautions for avoiding illness and injury.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          <strong>Electricity</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The Master Plumbers' Association calls electricity 'plumbing's hidden\r\n          killer'. Metal pipes are often conductive and so gloves which provide\r\n          insulation should form part of a plumber's tool kit, as should a\r\n          plumbing voltage monitor and a volt tester. Gloves should be checked\r\n          prior to every use and replaced every 12 to 14 months. Electrical\r\n          equipment like bridging conductors should be regularly checked, with\r\n          appropriate tags on the equipment to verify its safety. The project\r\n          should be stopped immediately if there is any sign of electricity, so\r\n          that the power can be disconnected by a qualified electrician prior to\r\n          continuing work.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"mb-4 mt-6\">\r\n          <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n            <strong>Questions 21-27</strong>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n            Read the text below and answer Questions 21-27.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <h4\r\n          className=\"font-bold mb-2 mt-6\"\r\n          id=\"How_to_manage_flexible_working_with_your_employees\"\r\n        >\r\n          How to manage flexible working with your employees\r\n        </h4>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          There is no denying that flexible working has grown enormously in\r\n          recent years. It does, however, require careful management.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          When it comes to implementing flexible working one word is key: trust.\r\n          All flexible workers should be trusted and given well-defined\r\n          objectives from the start and their contribution should be assessed\r\n          according to their output, as opposed to the time they spend on the\r\n          job. It can be a big step to implement such as change in your\r\n          business, so if you are slightly cautious then I recommend perhaps\r\n          setting up an end-of-the-day review to see how much progress has been\r\n          made. As all parties find their feet with the new set-up, this contact\r\n          can slowly be reduced.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          In my eyes, it is also vital that there is shared calendar access for\r\n          everyone so that people can see where their colleagues are each day.\r\n          This way if they need to catch up with someone they can plan when to\r\n          do so. Technology now exists to enable employees to stay in touch with\r\n          other members of staff and external partners. iMeet, for example, is a\r\n          tool which allows all forms of collaboration for remote working, from\r\n          video conferencing, live chat and file sharing to screen sharing. The\r\n          new breed of worker is therefore fully equipped to work productively\r\n          away from the office, and can still feel like they're in the same room\r\n          as others when necessary.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          In my experience, employees are often more productive working at home\r\n          as they can work the exact hours they want and do not have to cope\r\n          with distraction caused by other employees. Being outside the confines\r\n          of the office walls also appears to foster creativity. In addition, we\r\n          find staff are more motivated as they have a better work-life balance.\r\n          In terms of the business, we find this helps with top talent\r\n          recruitment and staff retention, and a happy workforce is a more\r\n          successful one.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      {/* SECTION 3 */}\r\n      <div className=\"mb-8\">\r\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4\" id=\"SECTION_3\">\r\n          SECTION 3\r\n        </h3>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n            <strong>Questions 28-40</strong>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n            Read the text below and answer Questions 28-40.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-2\" id=\"Preventing_the_theft_of_turtle_eggs\">\r\n          Preventing the theft of turtle eggs\r\n        </h4>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4 italic\">\r\n          Conservationists and law enforcement have struggled to prevent\r\n          wildlife trafficking.

However, as human populations exploded and as sea\r\n          turtles began to confront additional threats such as intensive\r\n          fishing, beach development and climate change, sea turtle populations\r\n          declined precipitously. Today, all but one of the world's seven\r\n          species of sea turtles are considered threatened according to the\r\n          IUCN* Red List. And the one that's not – the flatback turtle – is\r\n          listed as data deficient, which means scientists simply don't know how\r\n          it's doing.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          <strong>B</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          One major problem is that every year millions of sea turtle eggs are\r\n          illegally taken by poachers for sale on the black market. The\r\n          situation is particularly serious in Nicaragua, in Central America,\r\n          which is home to four sea turtle species.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Kim Williams-Guillen, who works for conservation body Paso Pacifico,\r\n          described the poaching of sea turtle nests on the beaches of Nicaragua\r\n          as 'uncontrolled, unregulated, extensive and contested'. Even the\r\n          best-protected beaches are plundered to some extent and it's not\r\n          uncommon to see poachers digging up nests just meters from tourists\r\n          watching sea turtles laying their clutch at night, she said. This\r\n          poaching becomes particularly frenzied during the <em>arribadas</em> –\r\n          mass laying events where thousands of turtles nest on the same beach\r\n          for a single night in a biological strategy to overwhelm natural\r\n          predators.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          <strong>C</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          'Even with armed guards, the numbers of poachers overwhelm military\r\n          personnel by ten to twenty to one,' Williams-Guillen said. 'Although\r\n          many poachers are locals with limited resources, during these{\" \"}\r\n          <em>arribadas</em> there are influxes of gangs of poachers from larger\r\n          cities outside local communities. These are not just local poor people\r\n          without other options.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          But to protect the country's sea turtles, Williams-Guillen said\r\n          conservationists shouldn't just depend on catching low-level\r\n          operators. 'If one poacher decides to stop, another one will just step\r\n          into his place… we need to know more about the middlemen and people\r\n          higher up in the distribution chain,' she said.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          <strong>D</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Paso Pacifico's solution is the creation of high-tech sea turtle eggs:\r\n          fake eggs convincingly crafted to look like the real thing, but which\r\n          contain GPS tracking devices. These have the potential to reveal the\r\n          destination markets for trafficked sea turtle eggs.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Making convincing sea turtle eggs is not easy, and Paso Pacifico is\r\n          still working on perfecting a prototype. In particular, it's proving\r\n          quite problematic to create the right texture, since sea turtle eggs\r\n          are not covered in a hard shell like those of birds, but are quite\r\n          flexible.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          So Paso Pacifico brought in Lauren Wilde, a special effects artist in\r\n          the US, to create a convincing outer shell. First, Wilde had to get\r\n          her hands on the real thing. Since it's illegal to send sea turtle\r\n          eggs over the border, Wilde is using land turtle eggs from California.\r\n          'It was really eye opening and important for me to feel these eggs and\r\n          how the shell bends a little,' she said.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          To get the GPS device inside the shell, Paso Pacifico is using 3D\r\n          printers to make a plastic ball which will then have a GPS transmitter\r\n          fitted inside. This will take the place of the embryo inside the\r\n          shell. Lastly the fake shells will be sealed with silicone,\r\n          waterproofing them.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          <strong>E</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Sea turtles on average lay around 100 eggs in a nest, and once the\r\n          fake eggs are finished they will be slipped in with the real ones.\r\n          Williams-Guillen said it might even be possible to deliver fake eggs\r\n          into nests while poachers are at work. Wary of tourists, poachers will\r\n          often back off if strangers come near and then return when they have\r\n          gone. 'It would be pretty easy to drop an egg in the dark into a nest\r\n          they have been digging up,' she said.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Once the poacher picks up the fake egg along with the real ones,\r\n          conservationists and law enforcement agents will be able to track\r\n          them. Experts believe most of the stolen eggs eventually make their\r\n          way out of Nicaragua, possibly to El Salvador or Guatemala. However,\r\n          there is also growing concern that sea turtle eggs from Central\r\n          America are actually heading to the USA, from where they are sold on\r\n          to other countries around the world.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          <strong>F</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          To date, Paso Pacifico has yet to put a single fake egg in a nest. But\r\n          Williams-Guillen said she isn't too concerned that publicity for their\r\n          scheme will result in poachers looking for the eggs. 'The vast\r\n          majority of the poaching is happening at night, so already it is hard\r\n          to tell [the eggs] apart, and at this point, poachers and middlemen\r\n          are not closely inspecting eggs, but rather shoving them into a sack\r\n          as quickly as possible.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Of course, poachers will eventually become aware of the prospect of\r\n          fake eggs among the real ones – especially when customers try to bite\r\n          into an egg and break their teeth on the GPS transmitter instead. So,\r\n          Paso Pacifico plans to do a massive deployment of as many fakes as\r\n          possible to gather a lot of data before poachers get wise.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Knowing where the eggs go will allow conservationists and law\r\n          enforcement agents to focus their resources on the right places –\r\n          whether it be through awareness-building campaigns or crackdowns on\r\n          illegal sellers. And eventually Paso Pacifico hopes to share the\r\n          technology with interested parties around the world.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>",
