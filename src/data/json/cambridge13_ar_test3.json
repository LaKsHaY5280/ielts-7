In the western world, on the other hand, coconuts\r\n          have always been exotic and unusual, sometimes rare. The Italian\r\n          merchant traveller Marco Polo apparently saw coconuts in South Asia in\r\n          the late 13th century, and among the mid-14th-century travel writings\r\n          of Sir John Mandeville there is mention of 'great Notes of Ynde'\r\n          (great Nuts of India). Today, images of palm-fringed tropical beaches\r\n          are clichés in the west to sell holidays, chocolate bars, fizzy drinks\r\n          and even romance.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Typically, we envisage coconuts as brown cannonballs that, when\r\n          opened, provide sweet white flesh. But we see only part of the fruit\r\n          and none of the plant from which they come. The coconut palm has a\r\n          smooth, slender, grey trunk, up to 30 metres tall. This is an\r\n          important source of timber for building houses, and is increasingly\r\n          being used as a replacement for endangered hardwoods in the furniture\r\n          construction industry. The trunk is surmounted by a rosette of leaves,\r\n          each of which may be up to six metres long. The leaves have hard veins\r\n          in their centres which, in many parts of the world, are used as\r\n          brushes after the green part of the leaf has been stripped away.\r\n          Immature coconut flowers are tightly clustered together among the\r\n          leaves at the top of the trunk. The flower stems may be tapped for\r\n          their sap to produce a drink, and the sap can also be reduced by\r\n          boiling to produce a type of sugar used for cooking.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Coconut palms produce as many as seventy fruits per year, weighing\r\n          more than a kilogram each. The wall of the fruit has three layers: a\r\n          waterproof outer layer, a fibrous middle layer and a hard, inner\r\n          layer. The thick fibrous middle layer produces coconut fibre, 'coir',\r\n          which has numerous uses and is particularly important in manufacturing\r\n          ropes. The woody innermost layer, the shell, with its three prominent\r\n          'eyes', surrounds the seed. An important product obtained from the\r\n          shell is charcoal, which is widely used in various industries as well\r\n          as in the home as a cooking fuel. When broken in half, the shells are\r\n          also used as bowls in many parts of Asia.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Inside the shell are the nutrients (endosperm) needed by the\r\n          developing seed. Initially, the endosperm is a sweetish liquid,\r\n          coconut water, which is enjoyed as a drink, but also provides the\r\n          hormones which encourage other plants to grow more rapidly and produce\r\n          higher yields. As the fruit matures, the coconut water gradually\r\n          solidifies to form the brilliant white, fat-rich, edible flesh or\r\n          meat. Dried coconut flesh, 'copra', is made into coconut oil and\r\n          coconut milk, which are widely used in cooking in different parts of\r\n          the world, as well as in cosmetics. A derivative of coconut fat,\r\n          glycerine, acquired strategic importance in a quite different sphere,\r\n          as Alfred Nobel introduced the world to his nitroglycerine-based\r\n          invention: dynamite.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Their biology would appear to make coconuts the great maritime\r\n          voyagers and coastal colonizers of the plant world. The large,\r\n          energy-rich fruits are able to float in water and tolerate salt, but\r\n          cannot remain viable indefinitely; studies suggest after about 110\r\n          days at sea they are no longer able to germinate. Literally cast onto\r\n          desert island shores, with little more than sand to grow in and\r\n          exposed to the full glare of the tropical sun, coconut seeds are able\r\n          to germinate and root. The air pocket in the seed, created as the\r\n          endosperm solidifies, protects the embryo. In addition, the fibrous\r\n          fruit wall that helped it to float during the voyage stores moisture\r\n          that can be taken up by the roots of the coconut seedling as it starts\r\n          to grow.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          There have been centuries of academic debate over the origins of the\r\n          coconut. There were no coconut palms in West Africa, the Caribbean or\r\n          the east coast of the Americans before the voyages of the European\r\n          explorers Vasco da Gama and Columbus in the late 15th and early 16th\r\n          centuries. 16th century trade and human migration patterns reveal that\r\n          Arab traders and European sailors are likely to have moved coconuts\r\n          from South and Southeast Asia to Africa and then across the Atlantic\r\n          to the east coast of America. But the origin of coconuts discovered\r\n          along the west coast of America by 16th century sailors has been the\r\n          subject of centuries of discussion. Two diametrically opposed origins\r\n          have been proposed: that they came from Asia, or that they were native\r\n          to America. Both suggestions have problems. In Asia, there is a large\r\n          degree of coconut diversity and evidence of millennia of human use –\r\n          but there are no relatives growing in the wild. In America, there are\r\n          close coconut relatives, but no evidence that coconuts are indigenous.\r\n          These problems have led to the intriguing suggestion that coconuts\r\n          originated on coral islands in the Pacific and were dispersed from\r\n          there.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h2 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4 mt-8\">READING PASSAGE 2</h2>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 14-26</strong>{\" \"}\r\n          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3 className=\"font-bold mb-2\">\r\n          How baby talk gives infant brains a boost\r\n        </h3>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">A</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The typical way of talking to a baby – high-pitched, exaggerated and\r\n          repetitious – is a source of fascination for linguists who hope to\r\n          understand how 'baby talk' impacts on learning. Most babies start\r\n          developing their hearing while still in the womb, prompting some\r\n          hopeful parents to play classical music to their pregnant bellies.\r\n          Some research even suggests that infants are listening to adult speech\r\n          as early as 10 weeks before being born, gathering the basic building\r\n          blocks of their family's native tongue.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">B</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Early language exposure seems to have benefits to the brain – for\r\n          instance, studies suggest that babies raised in bilingual homes are\r\n          better at learning how to mentally prioritize information. So how does\r\n          the sweet if sometimes absurd sound of infant-directed speech\r\n          influence a baby's development? Here are some recent studies that\r\n          explore the science behind baby talk.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">C</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Fathers don't use baby talk as often or in the same ways as mothers –\r\n          and that's perfectly OK, according to a new study. Mark VanDam of\r\n          Washington State University at Spokane and colleagues equipped parents\r\n          with recording devices and speech-recognition software to study the\r\n          way they interacted with their youngsters during a normal day. 'We\r\n          found that moms do exactly what you'd expect and what's been described\r\n          many times over,' VanDam explains. 'But we found that dads aren't\r\n          doing the same thing. Dads didn't raise their pitch or fundamental\r\n          frequency when they talked to kids.' Their role may be rooted in what\r\n          is called the bridge hypothesis, which dates back to 1975. It suggests\r\n          that fathers use less familial language to provide their children with\r\n          a bridge to the kind of speech they'll hear in public. 'The idea is\r\n          that a kid gets to practice a certain kind of speech with mom and\r\n          another kind of speech with dad, so the kid then has a wider\r\n          repertoire of kinds of speech to practice,' says VanDam.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">D</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Scientists from the University of Washington and the University of\r\n          Connecticut collected thousands of 30-second conversations between\r\n          parents and their babies, fitting 26 children with audio-recording\r\n          vests that captured language and sound during a typical eight-hour\r\n          day. The study found that the more baby talk parents used, the more\r\n          their youngsters began to babble. And when researchers saw the same\r\n          babies at age two, they found that frequent baby talk had dramatically\r\n          boosted vocabulary, regardless of socioeconomic status. 'Those\r\n          children who listened to a lot of baby talk were talking more than the\r\n          babies that listened to more adult talk or standard speech,' says\r\n          Nairán Ramirez-Esparza of the University of Connecticut. 'We also\r\n          found that it really matters whether you use baby talk in a one-on-one\r\n          context,' she adds. 'The more parents use baby talk one-on-one, the\r\n          more babies babble, and the more they babble, the more words they\r\n          produce later in life.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">E</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Another study suggests that parents might want to pair their\r\n          youngsters up so they can babble more with their own kind. Researchers\r\n          from McGill University and Université du Québec à Montréal found that\r\n          babies seem to like listening to each other rather than to adults –\r\n          which may be why baby talk is such a universal tool among parents.\r\n          They played repeating vowel sounds made by a special synthesizing\r\n          device that mimicked sounds made by either an adult woman or another\r\n          baby. This way, only the impact of the auditory cues was observed. The\r\n          team then measured how long each type of sound held the infants'\r\n          attention. They found that the 'infant' sounds held babies' attention\r\n          nearly 40 percent longer. The baby noises also induced more reactions\r\n          in the listening infants, like smiling or lip moving, which\r\n          approximates sound making. The team theorizes that this attraction to\r\n          other infant sounds could help launch the learning process that leads\r\n          to speech. 'It may be some property of the sound that is just drawing\r\n          their attention,' says study co-author Linda Polka. 'Or maybe they are\r\n          really interested in that particular type of sound because they are\r\n          starting to focus on their own ability to make sounds. We are\r\n          speculating here but it might catch their attention because they\r\n          recognize it as a sound they could possibly make.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">F</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          In a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of\r\n          Sciences, a total of 57 babies from two slightly different age groups\r\n          – seven months and eleven and a half months – were played a number of\r\n          syllables from both their native language (English) and a non-native\r\n          tongue (Spanish). The infants were placed in a brain-activation\r\n          scanner that recorded activity in a brain region known to guide the\r\n          motor movements that produce speech. The results suggest that\r\n          listening to baby talk prompts infant brains to start practicing their\r\n          language skills. 'Finding activation in motor areas of the brain when\r\n          infants are simply listening is significant, because it means the baby\r\n          brain is engaged in trying to talk back right from the start, and\r\n          suggests that seven-month-olds' brains are already trying to figure\r\n          out how to make the right movements that will produce words,' says\r\n          co-author Patricia Kuhl. Another interesting finding was that while\r\n          the seven-month-olds responded to all speech sounds regardless of\r\n          language, the brains of the older infants worked harder at the motor\r\n          activations of non-native sounds compared to native sounds. The study\r\n          may have also uncovered a process by which babies recognize\r\n          differences between their native language and other tongues.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h2 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4 mt-8\">READING PASSAGE 3</h2>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>{\" \"}\r\n          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3 className=\"font-bold mb-2\">\r\n          Whatever happened to the Harappan Civilisation?\r\n        </h3>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"italic mb-4\">\r\n          New research sheds light on the disappearance of an ancient society\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">A</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The Harappan Civilisation of ancient Pakistan and India flourished\r\n          5,000 years ago, but a thousand years later their cities were\r\n          abandoned. The Harappan Civilisation was a sophisticated Bronze Age\r\n          society who built 'megacities' and traded internationally in luxury\r\n          craft products, and yet seemed to have left almost no depictions of\r\n          themselves. But their lack of self-imagery – at a time when the\r\n          Egyptians were carving and painting representations of themselves all\r\n          over their temples – is only part of the mystery.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">B</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          'There is plenty of archaeological evidence to tell us about the rise\r\n          of the Harappan Civilisation, but relatively little about its fall,'\r\n          explains archaeologist Dr Cameron Petrie of the University of\r\n          Cambridge. 'As populations increased, cities were built that had great\r\n          baths, craft workshops, palaces and halls laid out in distinct\r\n          sectors. Houses were arranged in blocks, with wide main streets and\r\n          narrow alleyways, and many had their own wells and drainage systems.\r\n          It was very much a \"thriving\" civilisation.' Then around 2100 BC, a\r\n          transformation began. Streets went uncleaned, buildings started to be\r\n          abandoned, and ritual structures fell out of use. After their final\r\n          demise, a millennium passed before really large-scale cities appeared\r\n          once more in South Asia.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">C</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Some have claimed that major glacier-fed rivers changed their course,\r\n          dramatically affecting the water supply and agriculture; or that the\r\n          cities could not cope with an increasing population, they exhausted\r\n          their resource base, the trading economy broke down or they succumbed\r\n          to invasion and conflict; and yet others that climate change caused an\r\n          environmental change that affected food and water provision. 'It is\r\n          unlikely that there was a single cause for the decline of the\r\n          civilisation. But the fact is, until now, we have had little solid\r\n          evidence from the area for most of the key elements,' said Petrie. 'A\r\n          lot of the archaeological debate has really only been well-argued\r\n          speculation.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">D</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          A research team led by Petrie, together with Dr Ravindanath Singh of\r\n          Banaras Hindu University in India, found early in their investigations\r\n          that many of the archaeological sites were not where they were\r\n          supposed to be, completely altering understanding of the way that this\r\n          region was inhabited in the past. When they carried out a survey of\r\n          how the larger area was settled in relation to sources of water, they\r\n          found inaccuracies in the published geographic locations of ancient\r\n          settlements ranging from several hundred metres to many kilometres.\r\n          They realised that any attempts to use the existing data were likely\r\n          to be fundamentally flawed. Over the course of several seasons of\r\n          fieldwork they carried out new surveys, finding an astonishing 198\r\n          settlement sites that were previously unknown.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">E</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Now, research published by Dr Yama Dixit and Professor David Hodell,\r\n          both from Cambridge's Department of Earth Sciences, has provided the\r\n          first definitive evidence for climate change affecting the plains of\r\n          north-western India, where hundreds of Harappan sites are known to\r\n          have been situated. The researchers gathered shells of Melanoides\r\n          tuberculate snails from the sediments of an ancient lake and used\r\n          geochemical analysis as a means of tracing the climate history of the\r\n          region. 'As today, the major source of water into the lake is likely\r\n          to have been the summer monsoon,' says Dixit. 'But we have observed\r\n          that there was an abrupt change about 4,100 years ago, when the amount\r\n          of evaporation from the lake exceeded the rainfall – indicative of a\r\n          drought.' Hodell adds: 'We estimate that the weakening of the Indian\r\n          summer monsoon climate lasted about 200 years before recovering to the\r\n          previous conditions, which we still see today.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">F</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          It has long been thought that other great Bronze Age civilisations\r\n          also declined at a similar time, with a global-scale climate event\r\n          being seen as the cause. While it is possible that these local-scale\r\n          processes were linked, the real archaeological interest lies in\r\n          understanding the impact of these larger-scale events on different\r\n          environments and different populations. 'Considering the vast area of\r\n          the Harappan Civilisation with its variable weather systems,' explains\r\n          Singh, 'it is essential that we obtain more climate data from areas\r\n          close to the two great cities at Mohenjodaro and Harappa and also from\r\n          the Indian Punjab.'\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"font-bold mt-4 mb-2\">G</p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Petrie and Singh's team is now examining archaeological records and\r\n          trying to understand details of how people led their lives in the\r\n          region five millennia ago. They are analysing grains cultivated at the\r\n          time, and trying to work out whether they were grown under extreme\r\n          conditions of water stress, and whether they were adjusting the\r\n          combinations of crops they were growing for different weather systems.\r\n          They are also looking at whether the types of pottery used, and other\r\n          aspects of their material culture, were distinctive to specific\r\n          regions or were more similar across larger areas.
