They lent themselves to the\r\n          aesthetics of Persian architecture and were often built with\r\n          decorative elements.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Throughout the arid regions of India, step-wells have been fundamental\r\n          in providing communities with a water source for drinking, bathing,\r\n          irrigation and washing. Although it is said that stepwells date back\r\n          to around 550 AD, the earliest example found is the Stepping Well of\r\n          Asar dating from the 13th century.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Built from stone and maintained with steps leading down to the water\r\n          source, stepwells – known locally as baolis, baoris or vavs – are\r\n          often architecturally complex and vary widely in size and shape. The\r\n          stepwells were constructed to last for centuries, and even today many\r\n          of them still retain water after a millennium of use. In spite of\r\n          their ancient history and widespread existence, most stepwells were\r\n          gradually abandoned and eventually became neglected.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The journalist Victoria Lautman has spent years traveling through\r\n          India to document these historically significant and disappearing\r\n          structures. Her collection of images is arguably the most\r\n          comprehensive visual repository of stepwells to date. While conducting\r\n          research in India, Lautman visited more than 120 sites in seven\r\n          states.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Lautman told The Times of India: \"Little was known about stepwells and\r\n          I became a bit obsessed with figuring out what they looked like and\r\n          where they existed.\" She continues, \"all I knew was that they were\r\n          subterranean water-harvesting structures, some as old as the 2nd\r\n          century.\" With over 2,000 stepwells across India, some of the most\r\n          famous are in Delhi, which is home to almost 30, though many are in a\r\n          dilapidated state.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Stepwells were built with steps to make it easier to access water\r\n          throughout the year. As the water level drops, the stairs will still\r\n          reach down to the water. At the same time, they were an escape from\r\n          the sweltering Indian summer, when temperatures can reach in excess of\r\n          45 degrees. The cool interior of the wells would sometimes have been\r\n          as many as five stories below ground level, making them the perfect\r\n          place to pause, rest and socialise.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Lautman argues that the cultural and religious significance of\r\n          stepwells should not be understated. \"Stepwells were a way for the\r\n          elite to give back to the community, so they were generally financed\r\n          by wealthy landlords, or royalty.\" They were dedicated by wealthy\r\n          women as a gift to the community and many have been built in honour of\r\n          kings or deities. Stepwells were also locations where locals could\r\n          meet and women could escape their households to socialise.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          However, the arrival in India of the British Empire saw the beginning\r\n          of the end for stepwells. The British were afraid of the hygiene of\r\n          these water sources and feared they could breed disease: the water was\r\n          often dirty and mosquitoes bred there, which spread malaria. And\r\n          later, when modern water systems were introduced, reaching for a tap\r\n          was a lot easier than climbing down dozens of steps.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Nowadays, following years of neglect, many stepwells have been reduced\r\n          to garbage dumps, filled with sewage or debris, and have gone\r\n          completely dry. In an article for Slate magazine entitled \"Why Have So\r\n          Many of India's Beautiful Stepwells Been Left To Perish?\", Lautman\r\n          says: \"it's very much out of sight out of mind. Until recently, few\r\n          Indians had ever heard of them, or they were also called bowdies,\r\n          baolis, vavs, veers, or something else.\"\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          While India's stepwells continue to vanish, a few of them are still\r\n          used daily and even receive government maintenance. The states of\r\n          Gujarat and Rajasthan are home to some of the oldest and largest\r\n          examples, and are leading the effort to preserve these magnificent\r\n          structures. Locals soak in the waters of Gujarat's 15th-century\r\n          Rudabai Vav, while the same state's 11th-century Rani Ki Vav has been\r\n          listed as a Unesco World Heritage Site.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      {/* READING PASSAGE 2 */}\r\n      <div className=\"mb-8\">\r\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4\">READING PASSAGE 2</h3>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 14-26</strong>,\r\n          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-2\">The concept of intelligence</h4>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Looked at in one way, everyone knows what intelligence is; looked at\r\n          in another way, no one does. In other words, people all have\r\n          unconscious notions – known as 'implicit theories' – of intelligence,\r\n          but no one knows for certain what it actually is. This chapter\r\n          addresses how people conceptualize intelligence, whatever it may\r\n          actually be.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          But why should we even care what people think intelligence is, as\r\n          opposed to valuing what it actually is? There are several reasons\r\n          people's conceptions of intelligence matter.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          First, implicit theories of intelligence drive the way in which people\r\n          perceive and evaluate their own intelligence and that of others.\r\n          Consider, for example, a person who believes that intelligence is what\r\n          you know – that it is the amount of knowledge you have. That person\r\n          might value having children memorize capitals, states, countries, and\r\n          the like. The person might even favor a curriculum that emphasizes\r\n          such memorization, and standardized tests that measure how much\r\n          knowledge students have accumulated. In fact, a substantial part of\r\n          the audience for commercial knowledge-based game shows such as\r\n          Jeopardy! might implicitly believe, at some level, that intelligence\r\n          is largely knowledge.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          A teacher who believes that intelligence is what you know (knowledge)\r\n          and how quickly and accurately you can process it, will teach and test\r\n          differently from a teacher who believes that intelligence is how\r\n          creatively you can use knowledge, such as how well you can use the\r\n          knowledge to come up with new ideas. The latter teacher may value\r\n          curiosity and imagination more than the former teacher. Whether\r\n          intelligence really is all of these things (and probably it is to some\r\n          extent) is less important than what people believe it is, because they\r\n          will act in ways that reflect those beliefs.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Second, the emphasis placed on intelligence appears to vary across\r\n          cultures. For example, Taiwanese parents tend to place more emphasis\r\n          on their children's academic performance than do their counterparts in\r\n          the US, and academic performance depends in large part on intellectual\r\n          performance. Because cultures may define intelligence differently,\r\n          cross-cultural psychologists need to know what people in different\r\n          cultures actually believe intelligence to be. Once we know in what\r\n          ways conceptions are similar and in what ways they are different, we\r\n          can better compare those portions of intelligence that appear to be\r\n          common across cultures.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Third, people's implicit theories of intelligence may reveal important\r\n          keys to understanding the nature of human intelligence. Scientists'\r\n          explicit theories – the formal ones proposed and tested by\r\n          psychologists – may be useful in illuminating the nature of\r\n          intelligence as a scientific concept. But a complete understanding of\r\n          intelligence must also take into account people's implicit theories –\r\n          their conceptions of what intelligence is. For example, some\r\n          psychologists emphasize the role of both speed of mental processing\r\n          and knowledge in intellectual functioning. Others disagree, or at\r\n          least have different emphases.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          There is a much wider range of implicit theories of intelligence\r\n          across people and cultures than there is in our explicit (scientific)\r\n          theories of intelligence. For example, some people believe\r\n          intelligence to be entirely a matter of book learning, whereas others\r\n          see it more as 'street smarts'. Still others may believe intelligence\r\n          to be a matter of being able to adapt to one's environment, or of\r\n          being socially competent.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          For example, research has shown that Westerners – for example,\r\n          Americans – tend to view intelligence as a means for individuals to\r\n          devise categories and to engage in rational debate, while people in\r\n          some Eastern cultures – for example, some Chinese and Japanese – tend\r\n          to view intelligence as a way for members of a community to recognize\r\n          contradiction and complexity and to play their social roles\r\n          successfully. In Western cultures, intelligence tends to be viewed as\r\n          inherent in the person and as independent of the surrounding context.\r\n          In some Eastern cultures, it tends to be viewed as more holistic and\r\n          as deriving from the relationship between a person and the surrounding\r\n          context.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          These differences have important consequences. For instance, when\r\n          intelligence is viewed as a key to success, its emphasis by a parent\r\n          can lead either to achievement or to failure. A parent who thinks that\r\n          doing well depends on intelligence, and that intelligence is mostly\r\n          fixed, is likely to concentrate on how well her children perform in\r\n          school – say on spelling tests – rather than on how hard they work in\r\n          order to learn to spell. She might say, 'You got an A in spelling!\r\n          You're so smart!' The trouble is that the child may come to believe\r\n          that doing well is a matter of having intelligence and doing poorly is\r\n          a matter of not having it. When the child eventually does poorly on\r\n          some test, as will happen sooner or later, she may decide that she is\r\n          not smart after all, and give up. In other words, the parent's\r\n          well-meaning comment can create what psychologist Carol Dweck refers\r\n          to as a 'fixed' mindset toward intelligence.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          A parent who emphasizes the role of effort in doing well is more\r\n          likely to promote the development of what Dweck calls a 'growth'\r\n          mindset. In this case, the parent might say, 'You got an A in\r\n          spelling! That's great! You must have worked very hard at it!' When\r\n          the child later does encounter a failure, she will be less likely to\r\n          view the failure as reflecting on her intellectual ability than on her\r\n          effort.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          In sum, implicit theories can make a big difference in people's lives.\r\n          Parents' implicit theories of intelligence matter because they\r\n          determine the kinds of messages they send to their children. If they\r\n          believe intelligence is fixed, they are more likely to send messages\r\n          about ability; if they believe intelligence is acquirable through\r\n          effort, they are more likely to send messages about effort. What\r\n          messages a parent sends may make a big difference in the mindset the\r\n          children ultimately adopt toward their own intelligence.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      {/* READING PASSAGE 3 */}\r\n      <div className=\"mb-8\">\r\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4\">READING PASSAGE 3</h3>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-2\">\r\n          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>,\r\n          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 className=\"font-bold mb-2\">How we take ownership of objects</h4>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          It's mine! The psychology of ownership starts at a young age.\r\n          Psychologists Ori and Rom Brafman write about a well-known experiment\r\n          where the baby of one mother is placed with the baby of another, then\r\n          the mothers are told to retrieve their children. The children start\r\n          screaming and protesting as they are retrieved – they've been given to\r\n          the wrong mothers.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The Brafmans note that the babies are wearing diaper pins (the\r\n          experiment was conducted in the 1960s, before disposable nappies), and\r\n          the mothers have been switched around. But the mothers don't notice\r\n          the wrong pins; they only see their infant is in another woman's arms.\r\n          Eventually they stop and realize they don't have their child. While\r\n          that doesn't demonstrate the baby's sense of attachment, it does show\r\n          a thought process that has its roots in ownership.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Psychology professor Bruce Hood says that our possessive feelings\r\n          toward objects start at about age two. You don't explain to a toddler\r\n          that it is rude to grab a toy away from another child by using\r\n          abstract concepts of ownership. They already seem to understand what\r\n          it means that a toy belongs to them. Hood explored this by conducting\r\n          an experiment in which a copying machine was introduced to three-to\r\n          six-year-olds. They were shown that it could make exact physical\r\n          copies of any object. A child's favourite toy was then put into the\r\n          machine, and the researcher secretly swapped it with a copy that had\r\n          been made earlier. When the tray opened, almost all the children\r\n          wanted their original toy, not the copy that was identical in every\r\n          way, because of their special attachment to it.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The feeling of ownership is deeply embedded within us and emerges\r\n          during our most basic psychological processes. Research has found that\r\n          when people are randomly assigned objects, they quickly develop an\r\n          irrational attachment to them. In one study, participants were\r\n          separated into buyers and sellers and given the opportunity to buy and\r\n          sell coffee mugs. The sellers wanted a higher price for the mugs than\r\n          the buyers were willing to pay. The simple fact of being told they\r\n          owned the mug made them value it more highly.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          This preference for an object you've been given is called the\r\n          'endowment effect'. People who are given a piece of chocolate and the\r\n          option to switch it for another flavour usually won't. Another\r\n          example: US basketball fans were asked to choose randomly from several\r\n          posters and take the one they'd chosen; most refused to exchange their\r\n          poster for a different one two minutes later.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Our sense of ownership, then, is attached to things we feel we own.\r\n          This concept of ownership is psychological, but can be independent of\r\n          legal ownership. For example, you might have a strong sense of 'this\r\n          is my office' at work, even though the company legally owns it. The\r\n          Brafmans note that 'borders, both physical and psychological, have a\r\n          profound effect on our sense of ownership'. On the physical side,\r\n          anything you set off, enclose, or otherwise create a border around\r\n          feels more like yours.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          Consider the word 'homeland', used in politics. It implies that the\r\n          country is like a home, that 'the people of the homeland' own it, and\r\n          that comparing it to a home is an appropriate metaphor. We can think\r\n          of a country as something we own, because it has clearly defined\r\n          borders.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          The social psychologist Leon Festinger demonstrated the connection\r\n          between the effort we put into creating or acquiring something and our\r\n          psychological ownership of it. In one experiment, his subjects had to\r\n          solve difficult puzzles to be admitted to a group. They were told the\r\n          group would be discussing an interesting topic or a boring topic. It\r\n          turned out that the ones who solved puzzles to get into the boring\r\n          discussion rated the group as more attractive than those who got into\r\n          it without solving puzzles. The harder it is to get into or achieve\r\n          something, the more you'll value and feel attached to it – a kind of\r\n          psychological ownership.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          In 2010, psychologists Michael Norton, Daniel Mochon and Dan Ariely\r\n          studied the effect of putting effort into objects. In their\r\n          experiment, one group of people folded origami animals (a frog or\r\n          crane) and another group were just shown the animals. The ones who did\r\n          the folding were asked how much they'd pay for the object, and they\r\n          offered an amount five times the amount offered by the ones who didn't\r\n          fold. In fact, the folders valued their creations almost as highly as\r\n          the origami made by experts. The researchers called this the 'IKEA\r\n          effect', named for IKEA products that arrive as parts for the buyer to\r\n          assemble.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n          But in the workplace, this can lead to problems. Software project\r\n          managers, for example, sometimes need to scrap features of a product.\r\n          The engineers who've developed those features, though, can feel a\r\n          sense of ownership, and resent it when a feature is removed. They\r\n          perceive the feature as more important than it is. Removing something\r\n          that a person feels they own is perceived as a real loss – and the\r\n          deep feelings of ownership aren't equally distributed. When conflict\r\n          arises, parties on different sides of the issue might have very\r\n          different feelings of ownership.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>",
