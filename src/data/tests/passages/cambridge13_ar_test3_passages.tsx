        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">The coconut palm</h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          For millennia, the coconut has been central to the lives of Polynesian
          and Asian peoples. In the western world, on the other hand, coconuts
          have always been exotic and unusual, sometimes rare. The Italian
          merchant traveller Marco Polo apparently saw coconuts in South Asia in
          the late 13th century, and among the mid-14th-century travel writings
          of Sir John Mandeville there is mention of 'great Notes of Ynde'
          (great Nuts of India). Today, images of palm-fringed tropical beaches
          are clichés in the west to sell holidays, chocolate bars, fizzy drinks
          and even romance.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Typically, we envisage coconuts as brown cannonballs that, when
          opened, provide sweet white flesh. But we see only part of the fruit
          and none of the plant from which they come. The coconut palm has a
          smooth, slender, grey trunk, up to 30 metres tall. This is an
          important source of timber for building houses, and is increasingly
          being used as a replacement for endangered hardwoods in the furniture
          construction industry. The trunk is surmounted by a rosette of leaves,
          each of which may be up to six metres long. The leaves have hard veins
          in their centres which, in many parts of the world, are used as
          brushes after the green part of the leaf has been stripped away.
          Immature coconut flowers are tightly clustered together among the
          leaves at the top of the trunk. The flower stems may be tapped for
          their sap to produce a drink, and the sap can also be reduced by
          boiling to produce a type of sugar used for cooking.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Coconut palms produce as many as seventy fruits per year, weighing
          more than a kilogram each. The wall of the fruit has three layers: a
          waterproof outer layer, a fibrous middle layer and a hard, inner
          layer. The thick fibrous middle layer produces coconut fibre, 'coir',
          which has numerous uses and is particularly important in manufacturing
          ropes. The woody innermost layer, the shell, with its three prominent
          'eyes', surrounds the seed. An important product obtained from the
          shell is charcoal, which is widely used in various industries as well
          as in the home as a cooking fuel. When broken in half, the shells are
          also used as bowls in many parts of Asia.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Inside the shell are the nutrients (endosperm) needed by the
          developing seed. Initially, the endosperm is a sweetish liquid,
          coconut water, which is enjoyed as a drink, but also provides the
          hormones which encourage other plants to grow more rapidly and produce
          higher yields. As the fruit matures, the coconut water gradually
          solidifies to form the brilliant white, fat-rich, edible flesh or
          meat. Dried coconut flesh, 'copra', is made into coconut oil and
          coconut milk, which are widely used in cooking in different parts of
          the world, as well as in cosmetics. A derivative of coconut fat,
          glycerine, acquired strategic importance in a quite different sphere,
          as Alfred Nobel introduced the world to his nitroglycerine-based
          invention: dynamite.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Their biology would appear to make coconuts the great maritime
          voyagers and coastal colonizers of the plant world. The large,
          energy-rich fruits are able to float in water and tolerate salt, but
          cannot remain viable indefinitely; studies suggest after about 110
          days at sea they are no longer able to germinate. Literally cast onto
          desert island shores, with little more than sand to grow in and
          exposed to the full glare of the tropical sun, coconut seeds are able
          to germinate and root. The air pocket in the seed, created as the
          endosperm solidifies, protects the embryo. In addition, the fibrous
          fruit wall that helped it to float during the voyage stores moisture
          that can be taken up by the roots of the coconut seedling as it starts
          to grow.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There have been centuries of academic debate over the origins of the
          coconut. There were no coconut palms in West Africa, the Caribbean or
          the east coast of the Americans before the voyages of the European
          explorers Vasco da Gama and Columbus in the late 15th and early 16th
          centuries. 16th century trade and human migration patterns reveal that
          Arab traders and European sailors are likely to have moved coconuts
          from South and Southeast Asia to Africa and then across the Atlantic
          to the east coast of America. But the origin of coconuts discovered
          along the west coast of America by 16th century sailors has been the
          subject of centuries of discussion. Two diametrically opposed origins
          have been proposed: that they came from Asia, or that they were native
          to America. Both suggestions have problems. In Asia, there is a large
          degree of coconut diversity and evidence of millennia of human use –
          but there are no relatives growing in the wild. In America, there are
          close coconut relatives, but no evidence that coconuts are indigenous.
          These problems have led to the intriguing suggestion that coconuts
          originated on coral islands in the Pacific and were dispersed from
          there.

          How baby talk gives infant brains a boost
        </h3>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The typical way of talking to a baby – high-pitched, exaggerated and
          repetitious – is a source of fascination for linguists who hope to
          understand how 'baby talk' impacts on learning. Most babies start
          developing their hearing while still in the womb, prompting some
          hopeful parents to play classical music to their pregnant bellies.
          Some research even suggests that infants are listening to adult speech
          as early as 10 weeks before being born, gathering the basic building
          blocks of their family's native tongue.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Early language exposure seems to have benefits to the brain – for
          instance, studies suggest that babies raised in bilingual homes are
          better at learning how to mentally prioritize information. So how does
          the sweet if sometimes absurd sound of infant-directed speech
          influence a baby's development? Here are some recent studies that
          explore the science behind baby talk.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Fathers don't use baby talk as often or in the same ways as mothers –
          and that's perfectly OK, according to a new study. Mark VanDam of
          Washington State University at Spokane and colleagues equipped parents
          with recording devices and speech-recognition software to study the
          way they interacted with their youngsters during a normal day. 'We
          found that moms do exactly what you'd expect and what's been described
          many times over,' VanDam explains. 'But we found that dads aren't
          doing the same thing. Dads didn't raise their pitch or fundamental
          frequency when they talked to kids.' Their role may be rooted in what
          is called the bridge hypothesis, which dates back to 1975. It suggests
          that fathers use less familial language to provide their children with
          a bridge to the kind of speech they'll hear in public. 'The idea is
          that a kid gets to practice a certain kind of speech with mom and
          another kind of speech with dad, so the kid then has a wider
          repertoire of kinds of speech to practice,' says VanDam.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Scientists from the University of Washington and the University of
          Connecticut collected thousands of 30-second conversations between
          parents and their babies, fitting 26 children with audio-recording
          vests that captured language and sound during a typical eight-hour
          day. The study found that the more baby talk parents used, the more
          their youngsters began to babble. And when researchers saw the same
          babies at age two, they found that frequent baby talk had dramatically
          boosted vocabulary, regardless of socioeconomic status. 'Those
          children who listened to a lot of baby talk were talking more than the
          babies that listened to more adult talk or standard speech,' says
          Nairán Ramirez-Esparza of the University of Connecticut. 'We also
          found that it really matters whether you use baby talk in a one-on-one
          context,' she adds. 'The more parents use baby talk one-on-one, the
          more babies babble, and the more they babble, the more words they
          produce later in life.'
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Another study suggests that parents might want to pair their
          youngsters up so they can babble more with their own kind. Researchers
          from McGill University and Université du Québec à Montréal found that
          babies seem to like listening to each other rather than to adults –
          which may be why baby talk is such a universal tool among parents.
          They played repeating vowel sounds made by a special synthesizing
          device that mimicked sounds made by either an adult woman or another
          baby. This way, only the impact of the auditory cues was observed. The
          team then measured how long each type of sound held the infants'
          attention. They found that the 'infant' sounds held babies' attention
          nearly 40 percent longer. The baby noises also induced more reactions
          in the listening infants, like smiling or lip moving, which
          approximates sound making. The team theorizes that this attraction to
          other infant sounds could help launch the learning process that leads
          to speech. 'It may be some property of the sound that is just drawing
          their attention,' says study co-author Linda Polka. 'Or maybe they are
          really interested in that particular type of sound because they are
          starting to focus on their own ability to make sounds. We are
          speculating here but it might catch their attention because they
          recognize it as a sound they could possibly make.'
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of
          Sciences, a total of 57 babies from two slightly different age groups
          – seven months and eleven and a half months – were played a number of
          syllables from both their native language (English) and a non-native
          tongue (Spanish). The infants were placed in a brain-activation
          scanner that recorded activity in a brain region known to guide the
          motor movements that produce speech. The results suggest that
          listening to baby talk prompts infant brains to start practicing their
          language skills. 'Finding activation in motor areas of the brain when
          infants are simply listening is significant, because it means the baby
          brain is engaged in trying to talk back right from the start, and
          suggests that seven-month-olds' brains are already trying to figure
          out how to make the right movements that will produce words,' says
          co-author Patricia Kuhl. Another interesting finding was that while
          the seven-month-olds responded to all speech sounds regardless of
          language, the brains of the older infants worked harder at the motor
          activations of non-native sounds compared to native sounds. The study
          may have also uncovered a process by which babies recognize
          differences between their native language and other tongues.

          Whatever happened to the Harappan Civilisation?
        </h3>

        <p className="italic mb-4">
          New research sheds light on the disappearance of an ancient society
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Harappan Civilisation of ancient Pakistan and India flourished
          5,000 years ago, but a thousand years later their cities were
          abandoned. The Harappan Civilisation was a sophisticated Bronze Age
          society who built 'megacities' and traded internationally in luxury
          craft products, and yet seemed to have left almost no depictions of
          themselves. But their lack of self-imagery – at a time when the
          Egyptians were carving and painting representations of themselves all
          over their temples – is only part of the mystery.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          'There is plenty of archaeological evidence to tell us about the rise
          of the Harappan Civilisation, but relatively little about its fall,'
          explains archaeologist Dr Cameron Petrie of the University of
          Cambridge. 'As populations increased, cities were built that had great
          baths, craft workshops, palaces and halls laid out in distinct
          sectors. Houses were arranged in blocks, with wide main streets and
          narrow alleyways, and many had their own wells and drainage systems.
          It was very much a "thriving" civilisation.' Then around 2100 BC, a
          transformation began. Streets went uncleaned, buildings started to be
          abandoned, and ritual structures fell out of use. After their final
          demise, a millennium passed before really large-scale cities appeared
          once more in South Asia.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Some have claimed that major glacier-fed rivers changed their course,
          dramatically affecting the water supply and agriculture; or that the
          cities could not cope with an increasing population, they exhausted
          their resource base, the trading economy broke down or they succumbed
          to invasion and conflict; and yet others that climate change caused an
          environmental change that affected food and water provision. 'It is
          unlikely that there was a single cause for the decline of the
          civilisation. But the fact is, until now, we have had little solid
          evidence from the area for most of the key elements,' said Petrie. 'A
          lot of the archaeological debate has really only been well-argued
          speculation.'
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A research team led by Petrie, together with Dr Ravindanath Singh of
          Banaras Hindu University in India, found early in their investigations
          that many of the archaeological sites were not where they were
          supposed to be, completely altering understanding of the way that this
          region was inhabited in the past. When they carried out a survey of
          how the larger area was settled in relation to sources of water, they
          found inaccuracies in the published geographic locations of ancient
          settlements ranging from several hundred metres to many kilometres.
          They realised that any attempts to use the existing data were likely
          to be fundamentally flawed. Over the course of several seasons of
          fieldwork they carried out new surveys, finding an astonishing 198
          settlement sites that were previously unknown.

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Now, research published by Dr Yama Dixit and Professor David Hodell,
          both from Cambridge's Department of Earth Sciences, has provided the
          first definitive evidence for climate change affecting the plains of
          north-western India, where hundreds of Harappan sites are known to
          have been situated. The researchers gathered shells of Melanoides
          tuberculate snails from the sediments of an ancient lake and used
          geochemical analysis as a means of tracing the climate history of the
          region. 'As today, the major source of water into the lake is likely
          to have been the summer monsoon,' says Dixit. 'But we have observed
          that there was an abrupt change about 4,100 years ago, when the amount
          of evaporation from the lake exceeded the rainfall – indicative of a
          drought.' Hodell adds: 'We estimate that the weakening of the Indian
          summer monsoon climate lasted about 200 years before recovering to the
          previous conditions, which we still see today.'
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          It has long been thought that other great Bronze Age civilisations
          also declined at a similar time, with a global-scale climate event
          being seen as the cause. While it is possible that these local-scale
          processes were linked, the real archaeological interest lies in
          understanding the impact of these larger-scale events on different
          environments and different populations. 'Considering the vast area of
          the Harappan Civilisation with its variable weather systems,' explains
          Singh, 'it is essential that we obtain more climate data from areas
          close to the two great cities at Mohenjodaro and Harappa and also from
          the Indian Punjab.'
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">G</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Petrie and Singh's team is now examining archaeological records and
          trying to understand details of how people led their lives in the
          region five millennia ago. They are analysing grains cultivated at the
          time, and trying to work out whether they were grown under extreme
          conditions of water stress, and whether they were adjusting the
          combinations of crops they were growing for different weather systems.
          They are also looking at whether the types of pottery used, and other
          aspects of their material culture, were distinctive to specific
          regions or were more similar across larger areas. This gives us
          insight into the types of interactive networks that the population was
          involved in, and whether those changed.

          Petrie believes that archaeologists are in a unique position to
          investigate how past societies responded to environmental and climatic
          change. 'By investigating responses to environmental pressures and
          threats, we can learn from the past to engage with the public, and the
          relevant governmental and administrative bodies, to be more proactive
          in issues such as the management and administration of water supply,
          the balance of urban and rural development, and the importance of
          preserving cultural heritage in the future.'
