        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Nutmeg – a valuable spice</h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The nutmeg tree, <em>Myristica fragrans</em>, is a large evergreen
          tree native to Southeast Asia. Until the late 18th century, it only
          grew in one place in the world: a small group of islands in the Banda
          Sea, part of the Moluccas – or Spice Islands – in northeastern
          Indonesia. The tree is thickly branched with dense foliage of tough,
          dark green oval leaves, and produces small, yellow, bell-shaped
          flowers and pale yellow pear-shaped fruits. The fruit is encased in a
          flesh husk. When the fruit is ripe, this husk splits into two halves
          along a ridge running the length of the fruit. Inside is a
          purple-brown shiny seed, 2-3 cm long by about 2 cm across, surrounded
          by a lacy red or crimson covering called an 'aril'. These are the
          sources of the two spices nutmeg and mace, the former being produced
          from the dried seed and the latter from the aril.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Nutmeg was a highly prized and costly ingredient in European cuisine
          in the Middle Ages, and was used as a flavouring, medicinal, and
          preservative agent. Throughout this period, the Arabs were the
          exclusive importers of the spice to Europe. They sold nutmeg for high
          prices to merchants based in Venice, but they never revealed the exact
          location of the source of this extremely valuable commodity. The
          Arab-Venetian dominance of the trade finally ended in 1512, when the
          Portuguese reached the Banda Islands and began exploiting its precious
          resources.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Always in danger of competition from neighbouring Spain, the
          Portuguese began subcontracting their spice distribution to Dutch
          traders. Profits began to flow into the Netherlands, and the Dutch
          commercial fleet swiftly grew into one of the largest in the world.
          The Dutch quietly gained control of most of the shipping and trading
          of spices in Northern Europe. Then, in 1580, Portugal fell under
          Spanish rule, and by the end of the 16th century the Dutch found
          themselves locked out of the market. As prices for pepper, nutmeg, and
          other spices soared across Europe, they decided to fight back.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In 1602, Dutch merchants founded the VOC, a trading corporation better
          known as the Dutch East India Company. By 1617, the VOC was the
          richest commercial operation in the world. The company had 50,000
          employees worldwide, with a private army of 30,000 men and a fleet of
          200 ships. At the same time, thousands of people across Europe were
          dying of the plague, a highly contagious and deadly disease. Doctors
          were desperate for a way to stop the spread of this disease, and they
          decided nutmeg held the cure. Everybody wanted nutmeg, and many were
          willing to spare no expense to have it. Nutmeg bought for a few
          pennies in Indonesia could be sold for 68,000 times its original cost
          on the streets of London. The only problem was the short supply. And
          that's where the Dutch found their opportunity.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Banda Islands were ruled by local sultans who insisted on
          maintaining a neutral trading policy towards foreign powers. This
          allowed them to avoid the presence of Portuguese or Spanish troops on
          their soil, but it also left them unprotected from other invaders. In
          1621, the Dutch arrived and took over. Once securely in control of the
          Bandas, the Dutch went to work protecting their new investment. They
          concentrated all nutmeg production into a few easily guarded areas,
          uprooting and destroying any trees outside the plantation zones.
          Anyone caught growing a nutmeg seedling or carrying seeds without the
          proper authority was severely punished. In addition, all exported
          nutmeg was covered with lime to make sure there was no chance a
          fertile seed which could be grown elsewhere would leave the islands.
          There was only one obstacle to Dutch domination. One of the Banda
          Islands, a sliver of land called Run, only 3 km long by less than 1 km
          wide, was under the control of the British. After decades of fighting
          for control of this tiny island, the Dutch and British arrived at a
          compromise settlement, the Treaty of Breda, in 1667. Intent on
          securing their hold over every nutmeg-producing island, the Dutch
          offered a trade: if the British would give them the island of Run,
          they would in turn give Britain a distant and much less valuable
          island in North America. The British agreed. That other island was
          Manhattan, which is how New Amsterdam became New York. The Dutch now
          had a monopoly over the nutmeg trade which would last for another
          century.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Then, in 1770, a Frenchman named Pierre Poivre successfully smuggled
          nutmeg plants to safety in Mauritius, an island off the coast of
          Africa. Some of these were later exported to the Caribbean where they
          thrived, especially on the island of Grenada. Next, in 1778, a
          volcanic eruption in the Banda region caused a tsunami that wiped out
          half the nutmeg groves. Finally, in 1809, the British returned to
          Indonesia and seized the Banda Islands by force. They returned the
          islands to the Dutch in 1817, but not before transplanting hundreds of
          nutmeg seedlings to plantations in several locations across southern
          Asia. The Dutch nutmeg monopoly was over.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Today, nutmeg is grown in Indonesia, the Caribbean, India, Malaysia,
          Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka, and world nutmeg production is
          estimated to average between 10,000 and 12,000 tonnes per year.

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 14-26</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Driverless cars</h3>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The automotive sector is well used to adapting to automation in
          manufacturing. The implementation of robotic car manufacture from the
          1970s onwards led to significant cost savings and improvements in the
          reliability and flexibility of vehicle mass production. A new
          challenge to vehicle production is now on the horizon and, again, it
          comes from automation. However, this time it is not to do with the
          manufacturing process, but with the vehicles themselves.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Research projects on vehicle automation are not new. Vehicles with
          limited self-driving capabilities have been around for more than 50
          years, resulting in significant contributions towards driver
          assistance systems. But since Google announced in 2010 that it had
          been trialling self-driving cars on the streets of California,
          progress in this field has quickly gathered pace.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          There are many reasons why technology is advancing so fast. One
          frequently cited motive is safety; indeed, research at the UK's
          Transport Research Laboratory has demonstrated that more than 90
          percent of road collisions involve human error as a contributory
          factor, and it is the primary cause in the vast majority. Automation
          may help to reduce the incidence of this.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Another aim is to free the time people spend driving for other
          purposes. If the vehicle can do some or all of the driving, it may be
          possible to be productive, to socialise or simply to relax while
          automation systems have responsibility for safe control of the
          vehicle. If the vehicle can do the driving, those who are challenged
          by existing mobility models – such as older or disabled travellers –
          may be able to enjoy significantly greater travel autonomy.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Beyond these direct benefits, we can consider the wider implications
          for transport and society, and how manufacturing processes might need
          to respond as a result. At present, the average car spends more than
          90 percent of its life parked. Automation means that initiatives for
          car-sharing become much more viable, particularly in urban areas with
          significant travel demand. If a significant proportion of the
          population choose to use shared automated vehicles, mobility demand
          can be met by far fewer vehicles.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Massachusetts Institute of Technology investigated automated
          mobility in Singapore, finding that fewer than 30 percent of the
          vehicles currently used would be required if fully automated car
          sharing could be implemented. If this is the case, it might mean that
          we need to manufacture far fewer vehicles to meet demand. However, the
          number of trips being taken would probably increase, partly because
          empty vehicles would have to be moved from one customer to the next.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Modelling work by the University of Michigan Transportation Research
          Institute suggests automated vehicles might reduce vehicle ownership
          by 43 percent, but that vehicles' average annual mileage double as a
          result. As a consequence, each vehicle would be used more intensively,
          and might need replacing sooner. This faster rate of turnover may mean
          that vehicle production will not necessarily decrease
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Automation may prompt other changes in vehicle manufacture. If we move
          to a model where consumers are tending not to own a single vehicle but
          to purchase access to a range of vehicle through a mobility provider,
          drivers will have the freedom to select one that best suits their
          needs for a particular journey, rather than making a compromise across
          all their requirements.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Since, for most of the time, most of the seats in most cars are
          unoccupied, this may boost production of a smaller, more efficient
          range of vehicles that suit the needs of individuals. Specialised
          vehicles may then be available for exceptional journeys, such as going
          on a family camping trip or helping a son or daughter move to
          university.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          There are a number of hurdles to overcome in delivering automated
          vehicles to our roads. These include the technical difficulties in
          ensuring that the vehicle works reliably in the infinite range of
          traffic, weather and road situations it might encounter; the
          regulatory challenges in understanding how liability and enforcement
          might change when drivers are no longer essential for vehicle
          operation; and the societal changes that may be required for
          communities to trust and accept automated vehicles as being a valuable
          part of the mobility landscape.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">G</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          It's clear that there are many challenges that need to be addressed
          but, through robust and targeted research, these can most probably be
          conquered within the next 10 years. Mobility will change in such
          potentially significant ways and in association with so many other
          technological developments, such as telepresence and virtual reality,
          that it is hard to make concrete predictions about the future.
          However, one thing is certain: change is coming, and the need to be
          flexible in response to this will be vital for those involved in
          manufacturing the vehicles that will deliver future mobility.

        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4 mt-8">READING PASSAGE 3</h2>

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">What is exploration?</h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We are all explores. Our desire to discover, and then share that
          new-found knowledge, is part of what makes us human – indeed, this has
          played an important part in our success as a species. Long before the
          first caveman slumped down beside the fire and grunted news that there
          were plenty of wildebeest over yonder, our ancestors had learnt the
          value of sending out scouts to investigate the unknown. This questing
          nature of ours undoubtedly helped our species spread around the globe,
          just as it nowadays no doubt helps the last nomadic Penan maintain
          their existence in the depleted forests of Borneo, and a visitor
          negotiate the subways of New York.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Over the years, we've come to think of explorers as a peculiar breed –
          different from the rest of us, different from those of us who are
          merely 'well travelled', even; and perhaps there <em>is</em> a type of
          person more suited to seeking out the new, a type of caveman more
          inclined to risk venturing out. That, however, doesn't take away from
          the fact that we all have this enquiring instinct, even today; and
          that in all sorts of professions – whether artist, marine biologist or
          astronomer – borders of the unknown are being tested each day.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Thomas Hardy set some of his novels in Egdon Heath, a fictional area
          of uncultivated land, and used the landscape to suggest the desires
          and fears of his characters. He is delving into matters we all
          recognise because they are common to humanity. This is surely an act
          of exploration, and into a world as remote as the author chooses.
          Explorer and travel writer Peter Fleming talks of the moment when the
          explorer returns to the existence he has left behind with his loved
          ones. The traveller 'who has for weeks or months seen himself only as
          a puny and irrelevant alien crawling laboriously over a country in
          which he has no roots and no background, suddenly encounters his other
          self, a relatively solid figure, with a place in the minds of certain
          people'.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In this book about the exploration of the earth's surface, I have
          confined myself to those whose travels were real and who also aimed at
          more than personal discovery. But that still left me with another
          problem: the word 'explorer' has become associated with a past era. We
          think back to a golden age, as if exploration peaked somehow in the
          19th century – as if the process of discovery is now on the decline,
          though the truth is that we have named only one and a half million of
          this planet's species, and there may be more than 10 million – and
          that's not including bacteria. We have studied only 5 per cent of the
          species we know. We have scarcely mapped the ocean floors, and know
          even less about ourselves; we fully understand the workings of only 10
          per cent of our brains.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Here is how some of today's 'explorers' define the word. Ran Fiennes,
          dubbed the 'greatest living explorer', said, 'An explorer is someone
          who has done something that no human has done before – and also done
          something scientifically useful.' Chris Bonington, a leading
          mountaineer, felt exploration was to be found in the act of physically
          touching the unknown: 'You have to have gone somewhere new.' Then
          Robin Hanbury-Tenison, a campaigner on behalf of remote so-called
          'tribal' peoples, said, 'A traveller simply records information about
          some far-off world, and reports back; but an explorer{" "}
          <em>changes </em>the world.' Wilfred Thesiger, who crossed Arabia's
          Empty Quarter in 1946, and belongs to an era of unmechanised travel
          now lost to the rest of us, told me, 'If I'd gone across by camel when
          I could have gone by car, it would have been a stunt.' To him,
          exploration meant bringing back information from a remote place
          regardless of any great self-discovery.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Each definition is slightly different – and tends to reflect the field
          of endeavour of each pioneer. It was the same whoever I asked: the
          prominent historian would say exploration was a thing of the past, the
          cutting-edge scientist would say it was of the present. And so on.
          They each set their own particular criteria; the common factor in
          their approach being that they all had, unlike many of us who simply
          enjoy travel or discovering new things, both a very definite objective
          from the outset and also a desire to record their findings.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          I'd best declare my own bias. As a writer, I'm interested in the
          exploration of ideas. I've done a great many expeditions and each one
          was unique. I've lived for months alone with isolated groups of people
          all around the world, even two 'uncontacted tribes'. But none of these
          things is of the slightest interest to anyone unless, through my
          books, I've found a new slant, explored a new idea. Why? Because the
          world has moved on. The time has long passed for the great continental
          voyages – another walk to the poles, another crossing of the Empty
          Quarter. We know how the land surface of our planet lies; exploration
          of it is now down to the details – the habits of microbes, say, or the
          grazing behaviour of buffalo. Aside from the deep sea and deep
          underground, it's the era of specialists. However, this is to
          disregard the role the human mind has in conveying remote places; and
          this is what interests me: how a fresh interpretation, even of a
          well-travelled route, can give its readers new insights.
