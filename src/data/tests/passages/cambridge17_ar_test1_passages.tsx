          The development of the London underground railway
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In the first half of the 1800s, London's population grew at an
          astonishing rate, and the central area became increasingly congested.
          In addition, the expansion of the overground railway network resulted
          in more and more passengers arriving in the capital. However, in 1846,
          a Royal Commission decided that the railways should not be allowed to
          enter the City, the capital's historic and business centre. The result
          was that the overground railway stations formed a ring around the
          City. The area within consisted of poorly built, overcrowded slums and
          the streets were full of horse-drawn traffic. Crossing the City became
          a nightmare. It could take an hour and a half to travel 8 km by
          horse-drawn carriage or bus. Numerous schemes were proposed to resolve
          these problems, but few succeeded.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Amongst the most vocal advocates for a solution to London's traffic
          problems was Charles Pearson, who worked as a solicitor for the City
          of London. He saw both social and economic advantages in building an
          underground railway that would link the overground railway stations
          together and clear London slums at the same time. His idea was to
          relocate the poor workers who lived in the inner-city slums to newly
          constructed suburbs, and to provide cheap rail travel for them to get
          to work. Pearson's ideas gained support amongst some businessmen and
          in 1851 he submitted a plan to Parliament. It was rejected, but
          coincided with a proposal from another group for an underground
          connecting line, which Parliament passed.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The two groups merged and established the Metropolitan Railway Company
          in August 1854. The company's plan was to construct an underground
          railway line from the Great Western Railway's (GWR) station at
          Paddington to the edge of the City at Farringdon Street – a distance
          of almost 5 km. The organisation had difficulty in raising the funding
          for such a radical and expensive scheme, not least because of the
          critical articles printed by the press. Objectors argued that the
          tunnels would collapse under the weight of traffic overhead, buildings
          would be shaken and passengers would be poisoned by the emissions from
          the train engines. However, Pearson and his partners persisted.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The GWR, aware that the new line would finally enable them to run
          trains into the heart of the City, invested almost £250,000 in the
          scheme. Eventually, over a five-year period, £1m was raised. The
          chosen route ran beneath existing main roads to minimise the expense
          of demolishing buildings. Originally scheduled to be completed in 21
          months, the construction of the underground line took three years. It
          was built just below street level using a technique known as 'cut and
          cover'. A trench about ten metres wide and six metres deep was dug,
          and the sides temporarily held up with timber beams. Brick walls were
          then constructed, and finally a brick arch was added to create a
          tunnel. A two-metre-deep layer of soil was laid on top of the tunnel
          and the road above rebuilt.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Metropolitan line, which opened on 10 January 1863, was the
          world's first underground railway. On its first day, almost 40,000
          passengers were carried between Paddington and Farringdon, the journey
          taking about 18 minutes. By the end of the Metropolitan's first year
          of operation, 9.5 million journeys had been made.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Even as the Metropolitan began operation, the first extensions to the
          line were being authorised; these were built over the next five years,
          reaching Moorgate in the east to London and Hammersmith in the west.
          The original plan was to pull the trains with steam locomotives, using
          firebricks in the boilers to provide steam, but these engines were
          never introduced. Instead, the line used specially designed
          locomotives that were fitted with water tanks in which steam could be
          condensed. However, smoke and fumes remained a problem, even though
          ventilation shafts were added to the tunnels.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Despite the extension of the underground railway, by the 1880s,
          congestion on London's streets had become worse. The problem was
          partly that the existing underground lines formed a circuit around the
          centre of London and extended to the suburbs, but did not cross the
          capital's centre. The 'cut and cover' method of construction was not
          an option in this part of the capital. The only alternative was to
          tunnel deep underground.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Although the technology to create these tunnels existed, steam
          locomotives could not be used in such a confined space. It wasn't
          until the development of a reliable electric motor, and a means of
          transferring power from the generator to a moving train, that the
          world's first deep-level electric railway, the City & South London,
          became possible. The line opened in 1890, and ran from the City to
          Stockwell, south of the River Thames. The trains were made up of three
          carriages and driven by electric engines. The carriages were narrow
          and had tiny windows just below the roof because it was thought that
          passengers would not want to look out at the tunnel walls. The line
          was not without its problems, mainly caused by an unreliable power
          supply. Although the City & South London Railway was a great technical
          achievement, it did not make a profit. Then, in 1900, the Central
          London Railway, known as the 'Tuppenny Tube', began operation using
          new electric locomotives. It was very popular and soon afterwards new
          railways and extensions were added to the growing tube network. By
          1907, the heart of today's Underground system was in place.

          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Stadiums: past, present and future</h3>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Stadiums are among the oldest forms of urban architecture: vast
          stadiums where the public could watch sporting events were at the
          centre of western city life as far back as the ancient Greek and Roman
          Empires, well before the construction of the great medieval cathedrals
          and the grand 19th- and 20th-century railway stations which dominated
          urban skylines in later eras.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Today, however, stadiums are regarded with growing scepticism.
          Construction costs can soar above £1 billion, and stadiums finished
          for major events such as the Olympic Games or the FIFA World Cup have
          notably fallen into disuse and disrepair.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But this need not be the case. History shows that stadiums can drive
          urban development and adapt to the culture of every age. Even today,
          architects and planners are finding new ways to adapt the
          mono-functional sports arenas which became emblematic of modernisation
          during the 20th century.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The amphitheatre* of Arles in southwest France, with a capacity of
          25,000 spectators, is perhaps the best example of just how versatile
          stadiums can be. Built by the Romans in 90 AD, it became a fortress
          with four towers after the fifth century, and was then transformed
          into a village containing more than 200 houses. With the growing
          interest in conservation during the 19th century, it was converted
          back into an arena for the staging of bullfights, thereby returning
          the structure to its original use as a venue for public spectacles.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Another example is the imposing arena of Verona in northern Italy,
          with space for 30,000 spectators, which was built 60 years before the
          Arles amphitheatre and 40 years before Rome's famous Colosseum. It has
          endured the centuries and is currently considered one of the world's
          prime sites for opera, thanks to its outstanding acoustics.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The area in the centre of the Italian town of Lucca, known as the
          Piazza dell' Anfiteatro, is yet another impressive example of an
          amphitheatre becoming absorbed into the fabric of the city. The site
          evolved in a similar way to Arles and was progressively filled with
          buildings from the Middle Ages until the 19th century, variously used
          as houses, a salt depot and a prison. But rather than reverting to an
          arena, it became a market square, designed by Romanticist architect
          Lorenzo Nottolini. Today, the ruins of the amphitheatre remain
          embedded in the various shops and residences surrounding the public
          square.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          There are many similarities between modern stadiums and the ancient
          amphitheatres intended for games. But some of the flexibility was lost
          at the beginning of the 20th century, as stadiums were developed using
          new products such as steel and reinforced concrete, and made use of
          bright lights for night-time matches.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Many such stadiums are situated in suburban areas, designed for
          sporting use only and surrounded by parking lots. These factors mean
          that they may not be as accessible to the general public, require more
          energy to run and contribute to urban heat.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          But many of today's most innovative architects see scope for the
          stadium to help improve the city. Among the current strategies, two
          seem to be having particular success: the stadium as an urban hub, and
          as a power plant.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There's a growing trend for stadiums to be equipped with public spaces
          and services that serve a function beyond sport, such as hotels,
          retail outlets, conference centres, restaurants and bars, children's
          playgrounds and green space. Creating mixed-use developments such as
          this reinforces compactness and multi-functionality, making more
          efficient use of land and helping to regenerate urban spaces.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          This opens the space up to families and a wider cross-section of
          society, instead of catering only to sportspeople and supporters.
          There have been many examples of this in the UK: the mixed-use
          facilities at Wembley and Old Trafford have become a blueprint for
          many other stadiums in the world.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The phenomenon of stadium as power stations has arisen from the idea
          that energy problems can be overcome by integrating interconnected
          buildings by means of a smart grid, which is an electricity supply
          network that uses digital communications technology to detect and
          react to local changes in usage, without significant energy losses.
          Stadiums are ideal for these purposes, because their canopies have a
          large surface area for fitting photovoltaic panels and rise high
          enough (more than 40 metres) to make use of micro wind turbines.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Freiburg Mage Solar Stadium in Germany is the first of a new wave of
          stadiums as power plants, which also includes the Amsterdam Arena and
          the Kaohsiung Stadium. The latter, inaugurated in 2009, has 8,844
          photovoltaic panels producing up to 1.14 GWh of electricity annually.
          This reduces the annual output of carbon dioxide by 660 tons and
          supplies up to 80 percent of the surrounding area when the stadium is
          not in use. This is proof that a stadium can serve its city, and have
          a decidedly positive impact in terms of reduction of CO2 emissions.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">G</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Sporting arenas have always been central to the life and culture of
          cities. In every era, the stadium has acquired new value and uses:
          from military fortress to residential village, public space to theatre
          and most recently a field for experimentation in advanced engineering.
          The stadium of today now brings together multiple functions, thus
          helping cities to create a sustainable future.

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">To catch a king</h3>

        <p className="mb-4 italic">
          Anna Keay reviews Charles Spencer's book about the hunt for King
          Charles II during the English Civil War of the seventeenth century
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Charles Spencer's latest book, <em>To Catch a King</em>, tells us the
          story of the hunt for King Charles II in the six weeks after his
          resounding defeat at the Battle of Worcester in September 1651. And
          what a story it is. After his father was executed by the
          Parliamentarians in 1649, the young Charles II sacrificed one of the
          very principles his father had died for and did a deal with Scots,
          thereby accepting Presbyterianism* as the national religion in return
          for being crowned King of Scots. His arrival in Edinburgh prompted the
          English Parliamentary army to invade Scotland in a pre-emptive strike.
          This was followed by a Scottish invasion of England. The two sides
          finally faced one another at Worcester in the west of England in 1651.
          After being comprehensively defeated on the meadows outside the city
          by the Parliamentarian army, the 21-year-old king found himself the
          subject of a national manhunt, with a huge sum offered for his
          capture, through a series of heart-poundingly close escapes, to evade
          the Parliamentarians before seeking refuge in France. For the next
          nine years, the penniless and defeated Charles wandered around Europe
          with only a small group of loyal supporters.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Years later, after his restoration as king, the 50-year-old Charles II
          requested a meeting with the writer and diarist Samuel Pepys. His
          intention when asking Pepys to commit his story to paper was to ensure
          that this most extraordinary episode was never forgotten. Over two
          three-hour sittings, the king related to him in great detail his
          personal recollections of the six weeks he had spent as a fugitive. As
          the king and secretary settled down (a scene that is surely a gift for
          a future scriptwriter), Charles commenced his story: 'After the battle
          was so absolutely lost as to be beyond hope of recovery, I began to
          think of the best way of saving myself.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          One of the joys of Spencer's book, a result not least of its use of
          Charles II's own narrative as well as those of his supporters, is just
          how close the reader gets to the action. The day-by-day retelling of
          the fugitives' doings provides delicious details: the cutting of the
          king's long hair with agricultural shears, the use of walnut leaves to
          dye his pale skin, and the day Charles spent lying on a branch of the
          great oak tree in Boscobel Wood as the Parliamentary soldiers scoured
          the forest floor below. Spencer draws out both the humour – such as
          the preposterous refusal of Charles's friend Henry Wilmot to adopt
          disguise on the grounds that it was beneath his dignity – and the
          emotional tension when the secret of the king's presence was
          cautiously revealed to his supporters.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Charles's adventures after losing the Battle of Worcester hide the
          uncomfortable truth that whilst almost everyone in England had been
          appalled by the execution of his father, they had not welcomed the
          arrival of his son with the Scots army, but had instead firmly bolted
          their doors. This was partly because he rode at the head of what
          looked like a foreign invasion force and partly because, after almost
          a decade of civil war, people were desperate to avoid it beginning
          again. This makes it all the more interesting that Charles II himself
          loved the story so much ever after. As well as retelling it to anyone
          who would listen, causing eye-rolling among courtiers, he set in train
          a series of initiatives to memorialise it. There was to be a new order
          of chivalry, the Knights of the Royal Oak. A series of enormous oil
          paintings depicting the episode were produced, including a
          two-metre-wide canvas of Boscobel Wood and a set of six similarly
          enormous paintings of the king on the run. In 1660, Charles II
          commissioned the artist John Michael Wright to paint a flying squadron
          of cherubs* carrying an oak tree to the heavens on the ceiling of his
          bedchamber. It is hard to imagine many other kings marking the lowest
          point in their life so enthusiastically, or indeed pulling off such an
          escape in the first place.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Charles Spencer is the perfect person to pass the story on to a new
          generation. His pacey, readable prose steers deftly clear of modern
          idioms and elegantly brings to life the details of the great tale. He
          has even-handed sympathy for both the fugitive king and the fierce
          republican regime that hunted him, and he succeeds in his desire to
          explore far more of the background of the story than previous books on
          the subject have done. Indeed, the opening third of the book is about
          how Charles II found himself at Worcester in the first place, which
          for some will be reason alone to read <em>To Catch a King</em>.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The tantalizing question left, in the end, is that of what it all
          meant. Would Charles II have been a different king had these six weeks
          never happened? The days and nights spent in hiding must have affected
          him in some way. Did the need to assume disguises, to survive on wit
          and charm alone, to use trickery and subterfuge to escape from tight
          corners help form him? This is the one area where the book doesn't
          quite hit the mark. Instead its depiction of Charles II in his final
          years as an ineffective, pleasure-loving monarch doesn't do justice to
          the man (neither is it accurate), or to the complexity of his
          character. But this one niggle aside, <em>To Catch a King</em> is an
          excellent read, and those who come to it knowing little of the famous
          tale will find they have a treat in store.
