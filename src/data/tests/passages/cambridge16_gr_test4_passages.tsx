        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">The Best Hiking Boots</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Whether you're climbing a mountain or walking in the country, be sure
          to buy the right boots, writes Sian Lewis
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>A. Hanwag Tatra Boots</strong>
          <br />
          These boots are expensive but will give you a lifetime of wear. They
          are a wide fit and offer excellent ankle support. They passed our
          waterproof test when worn on long, rainy walks, although they are a
          bit heavy.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>B. Scarpa Peak Gore-tex Boots</strong>
          <br />
          These are good all-round boots that have kept our feet dry in heavy
          rain, snow and mud. They are comfortable from the moment you put them
          on, with no rubbing. They come up higher than some other boots,
          offering good ankle support, and fit both narrow and wide feet well.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>C. Berghaus Explorer Trek Boots</strong>
          <br />
          Our tester took these boots straight out of the box, put them on and
          did a 20-kilometre walk with no problems at all. They're nice and
          light, but still supportive and completely waterproof. The grip was
          good on both wet and dry surfaces. We only tested them in spring and
          summer, though, so we can't say how warm they'd be in winter.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>D. Salomon X Ultra Mid GTX Boots</strong>
          <br />
          These boots feel like comfortable trainers that hold your feet well.
          With good grip and made of material that allows air in, they're great
          when the weather is warm. But when we walked through a stream, a tiny
          amount of water did get in. This wasn't a big problem, though, and
          they dried out quickly afterwards.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>E. The North Face Hedgehog Trek GTX Boots</strong>
          <br />
          Our tester has had difficulty getting boots that fit her narrow feet
          but found these comfortable and supportive. They kept her feet dry in
          wet conditions, but they don't come up as high as some other boots,
          and so they might be best suited for summer walking.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>F. Merrell Moab FST Ice+ Thermo Boots</strong>
          <br />
          These boots were especially designed for winter and they certainly
          kept our feet warm and dry. They were good on frozen ground and snow,
          though on steep, slippery surfaces they were not quite as effective.
          Our tester, who walks a lot, felt they would probably not last as long
          as she would like.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>G. Aku Tribute II GTX Boots</strong>
          <br />
          Our tester found these boots really comfortable and fully waterproof
          in all weathers, with very good ankle support. They also coped well
          with steep, rough ground. But although they claim to be suitable for
          people with wider feet, he felt they were average width at best, and
          they took a while to soften up and become more flexible.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold my-4">How to choose hiking boots</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          When buying boots, comfort is the top priority. If they don't feel
          good in the shop, don't buy them. Your toes need room to move, but
          your feet shouldn't slide around. Choose a bad weather day to go
          shopping and wear the socks you'd usually wear when hiking. Ask to try
          the boots on a slope to check whether your feet slide forwards.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Most boots need breaking in, which you should do by wearing them round
          the house for a couple of days, or on short walks to begin with. Over
          time, they will become more flexible.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Consider the surfaces you'll be walking on. For hikes on
          well-maintained paths and in warm weather, fabric boots will probably
          do, but in more challenging conditions, including steep, wet or snowy
          slopes, you'll want sturdier boots, with soles that provide excellent
          grip.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Good ankle support is important for rocky terrain, as there's a risk
          of twisting an ankle, especially on descents. Also essential in wet
          areas is waterproofing. Gore-Tex boots are popular because they keep
          out rain but allow air to pass through, which helps keep feet cool in
          summer.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Leather boots are good for winter, and although they're more
          expensive, they'll last longer than some of the cheaper fabric boots
          if you look after them. After a wet walk, take out the inner soles to
          dry to help prevent bad smells, and consider buying a special cleaner
          to remove mud. Also, you might need to apply waterproofing cream from
          time to time.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But whichever boots you choose, they'll become like good friends:
          comfortable and dependable.

      <div className="mb-8">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4">SECTION 2: Questions 15-27</h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 15-27</strong>,
          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">The History of Laundering</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Throughout history, people have gone to great lengths to ensure they
          have clean clothes. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that an
          understanding of the materials used to make fabrics and the methods
          used to wash them is to track the progress of scientific thinking and
          social development.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>A)</strong> The earliest washing 'technology' would have
          involved nothing more than people pounding clothes on rocks by rivers
          or streams. Right up to the late 19th century, laundering was for many
          people still a matter of taking clothes to rivers and pounding them on
          rocks, although perhaps with the help of boards for scrubbing.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>B)</strong> The earliest synthetic soaps are thought to have
          originated in ancient Babylon around 4,000 years ago. Archaeologists
          once found a kind of soap in clay cylinders, the remains of which
          suggested they contained a form of soap-like material. Inscriptions on
          the cylinders mentioned they were used for the washing of clothes.
          Soap manufacture was established in most countries in the western
          world by the 7th century CE. Companies often used vegetable oils and
          animal fats as ingredients. Soap-making was a relatively simple
          process – at its most basic, it involved mixing fats with an alkaline
          substance such as wood ash, which contains potassium carbonate.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>C)</strong> The Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th
          centuries brought changes to soap production, including the
          development of continuous processing methods. This helped to increase
          the range of soap products available. In Britain, Andrew Pears created
          and patented the first transparent soap in 1789. It was considered a
          luxury item and Pears remained the brand of choice for many British
          households into the 20th century.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>D)</strong> In Britain, washing clothes was traditionally a
          woman's job, and it involved hard labour. She would be up at 5am to
          lay the fire, put water in the copper vessel for the hot water and get
          the dollies and line ready. 'Dollies' were wooden items that were used
          to push the clothes against the sides of the copper vessel. A big wash
          could take all day. Part of the job was to pass the wet items through
          a mangle, a machine formed by two rotating rollers that pressed the
          water from the clothes. This was one of the most dangerous jobs, since
          women did occasionally get their fingers and hair caught in the
          mechanism.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>E)</strong> The box mangle of the 18th and 19th centuries was
          a very different mechanism. It was more like a press than a roller.
          Wet clothes would be laid on a cloth that was wrapped around a
          cylinder under a rectangular box that contained heavy stones – often
          weighing between 15 and 30 kilos. The cylinder would be moved back and
          forth to press the moisture out of the clothes. The box mangle was a
          common sight in many middle-class houses as it helped to create a
          smoother appearance after the drying process was complete.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>F)</strong> Currently, researchers are attempting to design
          energy-efficient washing machines that optimise detergent performance
          to bring about effective wash cleaning at low wash temperatures. At
          the forefront of this research in the UK is the Institute of
          Mechanical Engineers at Leeds University, which has been engaged in
          work on laundry cleaning for over 40 years. Their current research is
          aimed at helping to make washing machines more sustainable. Within the
          laboratory, engineers test the performance of detergents as well as
          undertaking mechanical and electronic testing.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>G)</strong> Although thermometers were available for measuring
          wash bath temperature from the 17th century, there was no means of
          accurately controlling the temperature. It remained under manual
          control in most commercial laundries until the 1950s. The advent of
          electronic controls has brought about many improvements. Today,
          washing machines have features like load-detection, whereby
          information from sensors is used to determine the best wash cycle.
          This optimises the amount of water used and the wash program, thus
          adjusting the wash time according to the fabric and the load. You can
          now also buy a washing machine that uses fuzzy logic, which is a
          mathematical system where, instead of simply being on or off (binary),
          something can be partially on. So where a normal machine may have
          simply detected that the load is 5 kilos and so performed a preset 5
          kilo cycle, the fuzzy logic machine will determine the load to some
          level of precision and create what could be called a unique cycle,
          just for that load. This gives a better wash and uses less water and
          less electricity.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>H)</strong> In 2000, a government report was produced,
          highlighting how laundering could contribute to climate change. It
          suggested that to minimise damage to our environment we should wash
          our clothes at lower temperatures.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>I)</strong> Despite all the advantages of improved clothing
          care, there is considerable concern today that modern washing machines
          could be having a detrimental impact on our natural environment. Most
          clothing contains some plastic; for example, polyester, nylon and
          acrylic, making up 60% of our garments. Every time we put them in a
          washing machine, microfibers of plastic break off. Microfibers are so
          small that they drain out of our washing machines and can easily pass
          through sewage treatment plants. They flow directly into our rivers,
          lakes and oceans, and have even reached the North and South Poles.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>J)</strong> Microfibers are tiny but they can cause huge
          damage. Studies have indicated that these fibers are found in food and
          air, too. Scientists are studying them but still haven't found a way
          to completely stop them. In the meantime, a group of teachers and
          students from a London school has invented the Microfibre Catcher.
          It's a small device that fits inside a washing machine and catches
          over a third of the microfibers that would otherwise enter the water
          system. Alternatively, you can use a special bag that has been shown
          to catch up to 90-99% of the microfibers released during washing.

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 28-40</strong>,
          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">Trade across the Sahara Desert</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          For almost 1,000 years, trade caravans regularly crossed the Sahara
          Desert. African gold, salt, textiles, leather goods, and enslaved
          people went north, while in the opposite direction flowed the
          textiles, ceramics, glassware, and manufactured luxuries of North
          Africa, Europe, and Asia. Throughout this period, the gold of West
          Africa was especially significant in this trade. Although the Sahara
          is often regarded as a barrier, trade routes across this desert
          connected sub-Saharan Africa to the rest of the Mediterranean and
          Middle Eastern worlds in a complex commercial network.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          It is important to understand that there were several factors that
          made trans-Saharan travel difficult. For example, the sheer scale of
          the Sahara was a major problem. For travellers on foot or horseback,
          distances were almost impossible to navigate. The heat during the day
          could be intolerable, and at night temperatures could drop below
          freezing. The sandstorms of this region are legendary. In such storms,
          the winds can reach hurricane force and sand is stirred up so
          violently that people can become completely disoriented and visibility
          is severely reduced. Furthermore, much of the Sahara is not covered
          with sand but has a surface of gravel, and a rocky terrain that
          creates further obstacles. Another significant issue is that the
          Sahara is mostly a waterless region. What little water is available is
          to be found in oases - settlements built around isolated sources of
          water from underground rivers or springs.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          So how was trade carried out across the hostile environment of the
          Sahara? A major factor was the introduction of the camel as a beast of
          burden. Camels had always been present in parts of the Sahara, but
          were not used as domestic animals until around 300 CE, following the
          collapse of the Roman Empire. By the 8th century CE, however, they had
          acquired an important role in the growing trade across the desert. The
          domesticated camel can carry 150-200 kilograms and go for up to ten
          days without water. Its padded feet are well suited for walking on
          sand and its size allows it to cope with sandstorms better than
          horses. In addition, camels can be milked and, when they are too old
          to carry loads, they can be killed and their meat used for food. Two
          varieties of camel were used by caravans: one heavier beast was used
          on flatter terrain, and a lighter, more nimble variety was used on
          rockier ground.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Caravans were made up of a number of camels - occasionally over a
          thousand - and were often put together by several merchants who then
          appointed a leader for the whole party. Although there were a number
          of trans-Saharan routes, the typical caravan did not travel directly
          across the middle of the desert. Instead it followed a route from
          oasis to oasis, often determinedly keeping to valleys and depressions
          in the landscape. The leader, or caravaneer, needed a detailed
          knowledge of the route, including water sources. If the caravan had a
          military escort, the commander would often act on the caravaneer's
          advice about routes and about how to behave if they encountered local
          tribesmen. The typical Saharan caravan moved slowly, covering about
          three kilometers in an hour. Such caravans usually travelled for about
          ten hours daily, making the day's journey around 30 kilometers, after
          which the merchants, their trade goods and the camels stopped for the
          night.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There were a number of trading centres along the trans-Saharan route.
          On the northern fringes of the Sahara, Sijilmasa and Tunis were
          crucial for the routes heading north. These cities were important
          because merchants from the Middle East would meet with European
          commercial agents there as well as those bringing goods from south of
          the Sahara. In the south, Timbuktu in modern Mali became a critical
          point for trade from the sub-Saharan region. Located on the Niger
          River and founded in around 1100 CE, Timbuktu was a major trading
          center for salt, gold and other goods until well into the 19th
          century, and was also a great center of Islamic learning.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          A major commodity that was traded northwards was gold. Gold mined in
          West Africa was an important trading item and was also used as a
          convenient way of storing wealth. It was crucially important as a
          medium of exchange in the financial systems of North Africa and the
          Middle East, which were integrated into the economies of Europe and
          Asia. Salt, which was very valuable in the sub-Saharan economies, was
          shipped in large quantities to the south. The salt mines near the
          oasis of Taghaza produced more than 5,000 tons of salt every year in
          the 16th century. Animal skins and crafted leather were also important
          items in the caravans, while manufactured goods, such as ceramics,
          glassware and beads, were carried southwards.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Enslaved Africans were also brought north from the sub-Saharan region.
          Indeed, the word 'slave' derives from the medieval Latin word for
          'Slav' because in the early Middle Ages, many enslaved people were
          ethnic Slavs from Eastern and Central Europe. As the supply of
          European slaves declined in the 10th century, people from sub-Saharan
          Africa were enslaved to meet the labour needs in Europe as well as in
          the Middle East.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The trans-Saharan trade showed signs of change from the 15th century.
          The decline was related to several factors. First, European
          entrepreneurs were developing an oceanic route from Europe to West
          Africa. The Portuguese led the way in the second half of the 15th
          century and trading posts were established along the coast of West
          Africa in the 16th and 17th centuries. These provided European
          merchants with direct access to the gold of West Africa and other
          goods. Second, the political stability of the trans-Saharan routes was
          also changing. The Songhai Empire dominated the area between the Niger
          River and the Sahara for much of the 15th and 16th centuries, and was
          a major force in ensuring the safety of trade routes. In 1591, an
          invading army from Morocco defeated the Songhai, and this had a
          negative impact on long-distance trade. However, reports of the
          trans-Saharan trade's decline shouldn't be exaggerated. In the 19th
          century, long-distance caravans still headed from the southern Sahara
          regions northwards to places like Cairo, and trans-Saharan trade still
          exists today, albeit in a much reduced form.
