          Could urban engineers learn from dance?
        </h3>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The way we travel around cities has a major impact on whether they are
          sustainable. Transportation is estimated to account for 30% of energy
          consumption in most of the world's most developed nations, so lowering
          the need for energy-using vehicles is essential for decreasing the
          environmental impact of mobility. But as more and more people move to
          cities, it is important to think about other kinds of sustainable
          travel too. The ways we travel affect our physical and mental health,
          our social lives, our access to work and culture, and the air we
          breathe. Engineers are tasked with changing how we travel round cities
          through urban design, but the engineering industry still works on the
          assumptions that led to the creation of the energy-consuming transport
          systems we have now: the emphasis placed solely on efficiency, speed,
          and quantitative data. We need radical changes, to make it healthier,
          more enjoyable, and less environmentally damaging to travel around
          cities.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Dance might hold some of the answers. That is not to suggest everyone
          should dance their way to work, however healthy and happy it might
          make us, but rather that the techniques used by choreographers to
          experiment with and design movement in dance could provide engineers
          with tools to stimulate new ideas in city-making. Richard Sennett, an
          influential urbanist and sociologist who has transformed ideas about
          the way cities are made, argues that urban design has suffered from a
          separation between mind and body since the introduction of the
          architectural blueprint.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Whereas medieval builders improvised and adapted construction through
          their intimate knowledge of materials and personal experience of the
          conditions on a site, building designs are now conceived and stored in
          media technologies that detach the designer from the physical and
          social realities they are creating. While the design practices created
          by these new technologies are essential for managing the technical
          complexity of the modern city, they have the drawback of simplifying
          reality in the process.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To illustrate, Sennett discusses the Peachtree Center in Atlanta, USA,
          a development typical of the modernist approach to urban planning
          prevalent in the 1970s. Peachtree created a grid of streets and towers
          intended as a new pedestrian-friendly downtown for Atlanta. According
          to Sennett, this failed because its designers had invested too much
          faith in computer-aided design to tell them how it would operate. They
          failed to take into account that purpose-built street cafés could not
          operate in the hot sun without the protective awnings common in older
          buildings, and would need energy-consuming air conditioning instead,
          or that its giant car park would feel so unwelcoming that it would put
          people off getting out of their cars. What seems entirely predictable
          and controllable on screen has unexpected results when translated into
          reality.

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The same is true in transport engineering, which uses models to
          predict and shape the way people move through the city. Again, these
          models are necessary, but they are built on specific world views in
          which certain forms of efficiency and safety are considered and other
          experience of the city ignored. Designs that seem logical in models
          appear counter-intuitive in the actual experience of their users. The
          guard rails that will be familiar to anyone who has attempted to cross
          a British road, for example, were an engineering solution to
          pedestrian safety based on models that prioritise the smooth flow of
          traffic. On wide major roads, they often guide pedestrians to specific
          crossing points and slow down their progress across the road by using
          staggered access points divide the crossing into two – one for each
          carriageway. In doing so they make crossings feel longer, introducing
          psychological barriers greatly impacting those that are the least
          mobile, and encouraging others to make dangerous crossings to get
          around the guard rails. These barriers don't just make it harder to
          cross the road: they divide communities and decrease opportunities for
          healthy transport. As a result, many are now being removed, causing
          disruption, cost, and waste.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If their designers had had the tools to think with their bodies – like
          dancers – and imagine how these barriers would feel, there might have
          been a better solution. In order to bring about fundamental changes to
          the ways we use our cities, engineering will need to develop a richer
          understanding of why people move in certain ways, and how this
          movement affects them. Choreography may not seem an obvious choice for
          tackling this problem. Yet it shares with engineering the aim of
          designing patterns of movement within limitations of space. It is an
          art form developed almost entirely by trying out ideas with the body,
          and gaining instant feedback on how the results feel. Choreographers
          have deep understanding of the psychological, aesthetic, and physical
          implications of different ways of moving.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Observing the choreographer Wayne McGregor, cognitive scientist David
          Kirsh described how he 'thinks with the body', Kirsh argues that by
          using the body to simulate outcomes, McGregor is able to imagine
          solutions that would not be possible using purely abstract thought.
          This kind of physical knowledge is valued in many areas of expertise,
          but currently has no place in formal engineering design processes. A
          suggested method for transport engineers is to improvise design
          solutions and instant feedback about how they would work from their
          own experience of them, or model designs at full scale in the way
          choreographers experiment with groups of dancers. Above all, perhaps,
          they might learn to design for emotional as well as functional
          effects.

          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 14-26</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">
          Should we try to bring extinct species back to life?
        </h3>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The passenger pigeon was a legendary species. Flying in vast numbers
          across North America, with potentially many millions within a single
          flock, their migration was once one of nature's great spectacles.
          Sadly, the passenger pigeon's existence came to an end on 1 September
          1914, when the last living specimen died at Cincinnati Zoo. Geneticist
          Ben Novak is lead researcher on an ambitious project which now aims to
          bring the bird back to life through a process known as
          'de-extinction'. The basic premise involves using cloning technology
          to turn the DNA of extinct animals into a fertilised embryo, which is
          carried by the nearest relative still in existence – in this case, the
          abundant band-tailed pigeon – before being born as a living, breathing
          animal. Passenger pigeons are one of the pioneering species in this
          field, but they are far from the only ones on which this cutting-edge
          technology is being trialled.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In Australia, the thylacine, more commonly known as the Tasmanian
          tiger, is another extinct creature which genetic scientists are
          striving to bring back to life. 'There is no carnivore now in Tasmania
          that fills the niche which thylacines once occupied,' explains Michael
          Archer of the University of New South Wales. He points out that in the
          decades since the thylacine went extinct, there has been a spread in a
          'dangerously debilitating' facial tumour syndrome which threatens the
          existence of the Tasmanian devils, the island's other notorious
          resident. Thylacines would have prevented this spread because they
          would have killed significant numbers of Tasmanian devils. 'If that
          contagious cancer had popped up previously, it would have burned out
          in whatever region it started. The return of thylacines to Tasmania
          could help to ensure that devils are never again subjected to risks of
          this kind.'
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If extinct species can be brought back to life, can humanity begin to
          correct the damage it has caused to the natural world over the past
          few millennia? 'The idea of de-extinction is that we can reverse this
          process, bringing species that no longer exist back to life,' says
          Beth Shapiro of University of California Santa Cruz's Genomics
          Institute. 'I don't think that we can do this. There is no way to
          bring back something that is 100 per cent identical to a species that
          went extinct a long time ago.' A more practical approach for
          long-extinct species is to take the DNA of existing species as a
          template, ready for the insertion of strands of extinct animal DNA to
          create something new; a hybrid, based on the living species, but which
          looks and/or acts like the animal which died out.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This complicated process and questionable outcome begs the question:
          what is the actual point of this technology? 'For us, the goal has
          always been replacing the extinct species with a suitable
          replacement,' explains Novak. 'When it comes to breeding, band-tailed
          pigeons scatter and make maybe one or two nests per hectare, whereas
          passenger pigeons were very social and would make 10,000 or more nests
          in one hectare.' Since the disappearance of this key species,
          ecosystems in the eastern US have suffered, as the lack of disturbance
          caused by thousands of passenger pigeons wrecking trees and branches
          means there has been minimal need for regrowth. This has left forests
          stagnant and therefore unwelcoming to the plants and animals which
          evolved to help regenerate the forest after a disturbance. According
          to Novak, a hybridized band-tailed pigeon, with the added nesting
          habits of a passenger pigeon, could, in theory, re-establish that
          forest disturbance, thereby creating a habitat necessary for a great
          many other native species to thrive.

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Another popular candidate for this technology is the woolly mammoth.
          George Church, professor at Harvard Medical School and leader of the
          Woolly Mammoth Revival Project, has been focusing on cold resistance,
          the main way in which the extinct woolly mammoth and its nearest
          living relative, the Asian elephant, differ. By pinpointing which
          genetic traits made it possible for mammoths to survive the icy
          climate of the tundra, the project's goal is to return mammoths, or a
          mammoth-like species, to the area. 'My highest priority would be
          preserving the endangered Asian elephant,' says Church, 'expanding
          their range to the huge ecosystem of the tundra. Necessary adaptations
          would include smaller ears, thicker hair, and extra insulating fat,
          all for the purpose of reducing heat loss in the tundra, and all
          traits found in the now extinct woolly mammoth.' This repopulation of
          the tundra and boreal forests of Eurasia and North America with large
          mammals could also be a useful factor in reducing carbon emissions –
          elephants punch holes through snow and knock down trees, which
          encourages grass growth. This grass growth would reduce temperature,
          and mitigate emissions from melting permafrost.

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While the prospect of bringing extinct animals back to life might
          capture imaginations, it is, of course, far easier to try to save an
          existing species which is merely threatened with extinction. 'Many of
          the technologies that people have in mind when they think about
          de-extinction can be used as a form of "genetic rescue",' explains
          Shapiro. She prefers to focus the debate on how this emerging
          technology could be used to fully understand why various species went
          extinct in the first place, and therefore how we could use it to make
          genetic modifications which could prevent mass extinctions in the
          future. 'I would also say there's an incredible moral hazard to not do
          anything at all,' she continues. 'We know that what we are doing today
          is not enough, and we have to be willing to take some calculated and
          measured risks.'

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Having a laugh</h3>

        <p className="italic mb-4">
          The findings of psychological scientists reveal the importance of
          humour
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Humans start developing a sense of humour as early as six weeks old,
          when babies begin to laugh and smile in response to stimuli. Laughter
          is universal across all human cultures and even exists in some form in
          rats, chimps, and bonobos. Like other human emotions and expressions,
          laughter and humour psychological scientists with rich resources for
          studying human psychology, ranging from the development of language to
          the neuroscience of social perception.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Theories focusing on the evolution of laughter point to it as an
          important adaptation for social communication. Take, for example, the
          recorded laughter in TV comedy shows. Back in 1950, US sound engineer
          Charley Douglass hated dealing with the unpredictable laughter of live
          audiences, so started recording his own 'laugh tracks'. These were
          intended to help people at home feel like they were in a social
          situation, such as a crowded theatre. Douglass even recorded various
          types of laughter, as well as mixtures of laugher from men, women, and
          children. In doing so, he picked up on a quality of laughter that is
          now interesting researchers: a simple 'haha' communicates a remarkable
          amount of socially relevant information.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In one study conducted in 2016, samples of laughter from pairs of
          English-speaking students were recorded at the University of
          California, Santa Cruz. A team made up of more than 30 psychological
          scientists, anthropologists, and biologists then played these
          recording to listeners from 24 diverse societies, from indigenous
          tribes in New Guinea to city-dwellers in India and Europe.
          Participants were asked whether they thought the people laughing were
          friends or strangers. On average, the results were remarkably
          consistent: worldwide, people's guesses were correct approximately 60%
          of the time.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Researchers have also found that different types of laughter serve as
          codes to complex human social hierarchies. A team led by Christopher
          Oveis from the University of California, San Diego, found that
          high-status individuals had different laughs from low-status
          individuals, and that strangers' judgements of an individual's social
          status were influenced by the dominant or submissive quality of their
          laughter. In their study, 48 male college students were randomly
          assigned to groups of four, with each group composed of two low-status
          members, who had just joined their college fraternity group, and two
          high-status members, older student took a turn at being teased by the
          others, involving the use of mildly insulting nicknames. Analysis
          revealed that, as expected, high-status individuals produced more
          dominant laughs and fewer submissive laughs relative to the low-status
          individuals. Meanwhile, low-status individuals were more likely to
          change their laughter based on their position of power; that is, the
          newcomers produced more dominant laughs when they were in the
          'powerful' role of teasers. Dominant laughter was higher in pitch,
          louder, and more variable in tone than submissive laughter.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          A random group of volunteers then listened to an equal number of
          dominant and submissive laughs from both the high- and low-status
          individuals, and were asked to estimate the social status of the
          laughter. In line with predictions, laughers producing dominant laughs
          were perceived to be significantly higher in status than laughers
          producing submissive laughs. 'This was particularly true for
          low-status individuals, who were rated as significantly higher in
          status when displaying a dominant versus submissive laugh,' Oveis and
          colleagues note. 'Thus, by strategically displaying more dominant
          laughter when the context allows, low-status individuals may achieve
          higher status in the eyes of others.' However, high-status individuals
          were rated as high-status whether they produced their natural dominant
          laugh or tried to do a submissive one.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Another study, conducted by David Cheng and Lu Wang of Australian
          National University, was based on the hypothesis that humour might
          provide a respite from tedious situations in the workplace. This
          'mental break' might facilitate the replenishment of mental resources.
          To test this theory, the researchers recruited 74 business students,
          ostensibly for an experiment on perception. First, the students
          performed a tedious task in which they had to cross out every instance
          of the letter 'e' over two pages of text. The students then were
          randomly assigned to watch a video clip eliciting either humour,
          contentment, or neutral feelings. Some watched a clip of the BBC
          comedy <em>Mr. Bean</em>, others a relaxing scene with dolphins
          swimming in the ocean, and others a factual video about the management
          profession.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The students then completed a task requiring persistence in which they
          were asked to guess the potential performance of employees based on
          provided profiles, and were told that making 10 correct assessments in
          a row would lead to a win. However, the software was programmed such
          that is was nearly impossible to achieve 10 consecutive correct
          answers. Participants were allowed to quit the task at any point.
          Students who had watched the <em>Mr. Bean</em> video ended up spending
          significantly more time working on the task, making twice as many
          predictions as the other two groups.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Cheng and Wang then replicated these results in a second study, during
          which they had participants complete long multiplication questions by
          hand. Again, participants who watched the humorous video spent
          significantly more time working on this tedious task and completed
          more questions correctly than did the students in either of the other
          groups.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'Although humour has been found to help relieve stress and facilitate
          social relationships, traditional view of task performance implies
          that individuals should avoid things such as humour that may distract
          them from the accomplishment of task goals,' Cheng and Wang conclude.
          'We suggest that humour is not only enjoyable but more importantly,
          energising.'
