        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4">Stonehenge</h3>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          For centuries, historians and archaeologists have puzzled over the
          many mysteries of Stonehenge, a prehistoric monument that took an
          estimated 1,500 years to erect. Located on Salisbury Plain in southern
          England, it is comprised of roughly 100 massive upright stones placed
          in a circular layout.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Archaeologists believe England's most iconic prehistoric ruin was
          built in several stages with the earliest constructed 5,000 or more
          years ago. First, Neolithic* Britons used primitive tools, which may
          have been fashioned out of deer antlers, to dig a massive circular
          ditch and bank, or henge. Deep pits dating back to that era and
          located within the circle may have once held a ring of timber posts,
          according to some scholars.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Several hundred years later, it is thought, Stonehenge's builders
          hoisted an estimated 80 bluestones, 43 of which remain today, into
          standing positions and placed them in either a horseshoe or circular
          formation. These stones have been traced all the way to the Preseli
          Hills in Wales, some 300 kilometres from Stonehenge. How, then, did
          prehistoric builders without sophisticated tools or engineering haul
          these boulders, which weigh up to four tons, over such a great
          distance?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          According to one long-standing theory among archaeologists,
          Stonehenge's builders fashioned sledges and rollers out of tree trunks
          to lug the bluestones from the Preseli Hills. They then transferred
          the boulders onto rafts and floated them first along the Welsh coast
          and then up the River Avon toward Salisbury Plain; alternatively, they
          may have towed each stone with a fleet of vessels. More recent
          archaeological hypotheses have them transporting the bluestones with
          supersized wicker baskets on a combination of ball bearings and long
          grooved planks, hauled by oxen.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          As early as the 1970s, geologists have been adding their voices to the
          debate over how Stonehenge came into being. Challenging the classic
          image of industrious builders pushing, carting, rolling or hauling
          giant stones from faraway Wales, some scientists have suggested that
          it was glaciers, not humans, that carried the bluestones to Salisbury
          Plain. Most archaeologists have remained sceptical about this theory,
          however, wondering how the forces of nature could possibly have
          delivered the exact number of stones needed to complete the circle.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The third phase of construction took place around 2000 BCE. At this
          point, sandstone slabs – known as 'sarsens' – were arranged into an
          outer crescent or ring; some were assembled into the iconic
          three-pieced structures called trilithons that stand tall in the
          centre of Stonehenge. Some 50 of these stones are now visible on the
          site, which may once have contained many more. Radiocarbon dating has
          revealed that work continued at Stonehenge until roughly 1600 BCE,
          with the bluestones in particular being repositioned multiple times.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          But who were the builders of Stonehenge? In the 17th century,
          archaeologist John Aubrey made the claim that Stonehenge was the work
          of druids, who had important religious, judicial and political roles
          in Celtic** society. This theory was widely popularized by the
          antiquarian William Stukeley, who had unearthed primitive graves at
          the site. Even today, people who identify as modern druids continue to
          gather at Stonehenge for the summer solstice. However, in the mid-20th
          century, radiocarbon dating demonstrated that Stonehenge stood more
          than 1,000 years before the Celts inhabited the region.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Many modern historians and archaeologists now agree that several
          distinct tribes of people contributed to Stonehenge, each undertaking
          a different phase of its construction. Bones, tools and other
          artefacts found on the site seem to support this hypothesis. The first
          stage was achieved by Neolithic agrarians who were likely to have been
          indigenous to the British Isles. Later, it is believed, groups with
          advanced tools and a more communal way of life left their mark on the
          site. Some believe that they were immigrants from the European
          continent, while others maintain that they were probably native
          Britons, descended from the original builders.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          If the facts surrounding the architects and construction of Stonehenge
          remain shadowy at best, the purpose of the striking monument is even
          more of a mystery. While there is consensus among the majority of
          modern scholars that Stonehenge once served the function of burial
          ground, they have yet to determine what other purposes it had.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          In the 1960s, the astronomer Gerald Hawkins suggested that the cluster
          of megalithic stones operated as a form of calendar, with different
          points corresponding to astrological phenomena such as solstices,
          equinoxes and eclipses occurring at different times of the year. While
          his theory has received a considerable amount of attention over the
          decades, critics maintain that Stonehenge's builders probably lacked
          the knowledge necessary to predict such events or that England's dense
          cloud cover would have obscured their view of the skies.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          More recently, signs of illness and injury in the human remains
          unearthed at Stonehenge led a group of British archaeologists to
          speculate that it was considered a place of healing, perhaps because
          bluestones were thought to have curative powers.

          Living with artificial intelligence
        </h3>
        <p className="italic mb-4">
          Powerful artificial intelligence (AI) needs to be reliably aligned
          with human values, but does this mean AI will eventually have to
          police those values?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          This has been the decade of AI, with one astonishing feat after
          another. A chess-playing AI that can defeat not only all human chess
          players, but also all previous human-programmed chess machines, after
          learning the game in just four hours? That's yesterday's news, what's
          next? True, these prodigious accomplishments are all in so-called
          narrow AI, where machines perform highly specialised tasks. But many
          experts believe this restriction is very temporary. By mid-century, we
          may have artificial general intelligence (AGI) – machines that can
          achieve human-level performance on the full range of tasks that we
          ourselves can tackle.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          If so, there's little reason to think it will stop there. Machines
          will be free of many of the physical constraints on human
          intelligence. Our brains run at slow biochemical processing speeds on
          the power of a light bulb, and their size is restricted by the
          dimensions of the human birth canal. It is remarkable what they
          accomplish, given these handicaps. But they may be as far from the
          physical limits of thought as our eyes are from the incredibly
          powerful Webb Space Telescope.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Once machines are better than us at designing even smarter machines,
          progress towards these limits could accelerate. What would this mean
          for us? Could we ensure a safe and worthwhile coexistence with such
          machines? On the plus side, AI is already useful and profitable for
          many things, and super AI might be expected to be super useful and
          super profitable. But the more powerful AI becomes, the more important
          it will be to specify its goals with great care. Folklore is full of
          tales of people who ask for the wrong thing, with disastrous
          consequences- King Midas, for example, might have wished that
          everything he touched turned to gold, but didn't really intend this to
          apply to his breakfast.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          So we need to create powerful AI machines that are 'human-friendly'-
          that have goals reliably aligned with our own values. One thing that
          makes this task difficult is that we are far from reliably
          human-friendly ourselves. We do many terrible things to each other and
          to many other creatures with whom we share the planet. If
          superintendent machines don't do a lot better than us, we'll be in
          deep trouble. We'll have powerful new intelligence amplifying the dark
          sides of our own fallible natures.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          For safety's sake, then, we want the machines to be ethically as well
          as cognitively superhuman. We want them to aim for the moral high
          ground, not for the troughs in which many of us spend some of our
          time. Luckily they'll be smart enough for the job. If there are routes
          to the moral high ground, they'll be better than us at finding them,
          and steering us in the right direction.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          However, there are two big problems with this utopian vision. One is
          how we get the machines started on the journey, the other is what it
          would mean to reach this destination. The 'getting started' problem is
          that we need to tell the machines what they're looking for with
          sufficient clarity that we can be confident they will find it –
          whatever 'it' actually turns out to be. This won't be easy, given that
          we are tribal creatures and conflicted about the ideals ourselves. We
          often ignore the suffering of strangers, and even contribute to it, at
          least indirectly. How then, do we point machines in the direction of
          something better?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          As for the 'destination' problem, we might, by putting ourselves in
          the hands of these moral guides and gatekeepers, be sacrificing our
          own autonomy – an important part of what makes us human. Machines who
          are better than us at sticking to the moral high ground may be
          expected to discourage some of the lapses we presently take for
          granted. We might lose our freedom to discriminate in favour of our
          own communities, for example.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Loss of freedom to behave badly isn't always a bad thing, of course:
          denying ourselves the freedom to put children to work in factories, or
          to smoke in restaurants are signs of progress. But are we ready for
          ethical silicon police limiting our options? They might be so good at
          doing it that we won't notice them; but few of us are likely to
          welcome such a future.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          These issues might seem far-fetched, but they are to some extent
          already here. AI already has some input into how resources are used in
          our National Health Service (NHS) here in the UK, for example. If it
          was given a greater role, it might do so much more efficiently than
          humans can manage, and act in the interests of taxpayers and those who
          use the health system. However, we'd be depriving some humans (e.g.
          senior doctors) of the control they presently enjoy. Since we'd want
          to ensure that people are treated equally and that policies are fair,
          the goals of AI would need to be specified correctly.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          We have a new powerful technology to deal with- itself, literally, a
          new way of thinking. For our own safety, we need to point these new
          thinkers in the right direction, and get them to act well for us. It
          is not yet clear whether this is possible, but if it is, it will
          require a cooperative spirit, and a willingness to set aside
          self-interest.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Both general intelligence and moral reasoning are often thought to be
          uniquely human capacities. But safety seems to require that we think
          of them as a package: if we are to give general intelligence to
          machines, we'll need to give them moral authority, too. And where
          exactly would that leave human beings? All the more reason to think
          about the destination now, and to be careful about what we wish for.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4">An ideal city</h3>
        <p className="italic mb-4">
          Leonardo da Vinci's ideal city was centuries ahead of its time
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The word 'genius' is universally associated with the name of Leonardo
          da Vinci. A true Renaissance man, he embodied scientific spirit,
          artistic talent and humanist sensibilities. Five hundred years have
          passed since Leonardo died in his home at Chateau du Clos Luce,
          outside Tours, France. Yet far from fading into insignificance, his
          thinking has carried down the centuries and still surprises today.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The Renaissance marked the transition from the 15th century to
          modernity and took place after the spread of the plague in the 14th
          century, which caused a global crisis resulting in some 200 million
          deaths across Europe and Asia. Today, the world is on the cusp of a
          climate crisis, which is predicted to cause widespread displacement,
          extinctions and death, if left unaddressed. Then, as now, radical
          solutions were called for to revolutionise the way people lived and
          safeguard humanity against catastrophe.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Around 1486 – after a pestilence that killed half the population in
          Milan, Italy – Leonardo turned his thoughts to urban planning
          problems. Following a typical Renaissance trend, he began to work on
          an 'ideal city' project, which – due to its excessive costs – would
          remain unfulfilled. Yet given that unsustainable urban models are a
          key cause of global climate change today, it's only natural to wonder
          how Leonardo might have changed the shape of modem cities.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Although the Renaissance is renowned as an era of incredible progress
          in art and architecture, it is rarely noted that the 15th century also
          marked the birth of urbanism as a true academic discipline. The rigour
          and method behind the conscious conception of a city had been largely
          missing in Western thought until the moment when prominent Renaissance
          men pushed forward large-scale urban projects in Italy, such as the
          reconfiguration of the town of Pienza and the expansion of the city of
          Ferrara. These works surely inspired Leonardo's decision to rethink
          the design of medieval cities, with their winding and overcrowded
          streets and with houses piled against one another.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          It is not easy to identify a coordinated vision of Leonardo's ideal
          city because of his disordered way of working with notes and sketches.
          But from the largest collection of Leonardo's papers ever assembled, a
          series of innovative thoughts can be reconstructed regarding the
          foundation of a new city along the Ticino River, which runs from
          Switzerland into Italy and is 248 kilometres long. He designed the
          city for the easy transport of goods and clean urban spaces, and he
          wanted a comfortable and spacious city, with well-ordered streets and
          architecture. He recommended 'high, strong walls', with 'towers and
          battlements of all necessary and pleasant beauty'.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          His plans for a modem and 'rational' city were consistent with
          Renaissance ideals. But, in keeping with his personality, Leonardo
          included several innovations in his urban design. Leonardo wanted the
          city to be built on several levels, linked with vertical outdoor
          staircases. This design can be seen in some of today's high-rise
          buildings but was unconventional at the time. Indeed, this idea of
          taking full advantage of the interior spaces wasn't implemented until
          the 1920s and 1930s, with the birth of the Modernist movement.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          While in the upper layers of the city, people could walk undisturbed
          between elegant palaces and streets, the lower layer was the place for
          services, trade, transport and industry. But the true originality of
          Leonardo's vision was its fusion of architecture and engineering.
          Leonardo designed extensive hydraulic plants to create artificial
          canals throughout the city. The canals, regulated by clocks and
          basins, were supposed to make it easier for boats to navigate inland.
          Leonardo also thought that the width of the streets ought to match the
          average height of the adjacent houses: a rule still followed in many
          contemporary cities across Italy, to allow access to sun and reduce
          the risk of damage from earthquakes.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Although some of these features existed in Roman cities, before
          Leonardo's drawings there had never been a multi-level, compact modem
          city which was thoroughly technically conceived. Indeed, it wasn't
          until the 19th century that some of his ideas were applied. For
          example, the subdivision of the city by function- with services and
          infrastructures located in the lower levels and wide and
          well-ventilated boulevards and walkways above for residents – is an
          idea that can be found in Georges-Eugene Haussmann's renovation of
          Paris under Emperor Napoleon III between 1853 and 1870.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Today, Leonardo's ideas are not simply valid, they actually suggest a
          way forward for urban planning. Many scholars think that the compact
          city, built upwards instead of outwards, integrated with nature
          (especially water systems), with efficient transport infrastructure,
          could help modem cities become more efficient and sustainable. This is
          yet another reason why Leonardo was aligned so closely with modem
          urban planning and centuries ahead of his time.
