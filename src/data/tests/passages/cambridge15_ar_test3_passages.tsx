        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Henry Moore (1898-1986)</h3>

        <p className="italic mb-4">
          The British sculptor Henry Moore was a leading figure in the
          20th-century art world
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Henry Moore was born in Castleford, a small town near Leeds in the
          north of England. He was the seventh child of Raymond Moore and his
          wife Mary Baker. He studied at Castleford Grammar School from 1909 to
          1915, where his early interest in art was encouraged by his teacher
          Alice Gostick. After leaving school, Moore hoped to become a sculptor,
          but instead he complied with his father's wish that he train as a
          schoolteacher. He had to abandon his training in 1917 when he was sent
          to France to fight in the First World War.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          After the war, Moore enrolled at the Leeds School of Art, where he
          studied for two years. In his first year, he spent most of his time
          drawing. Although he wanted to study sculpture, no teacher was
          appointed until his second year. At the end of that year, he passed
          the sculpture examination and was awarded a scholarship to the Royal
          College of Art in London. In September 1921, he moved to London and
          began three years of advanced study in sculpture.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Alongside the instruction he received at the Royal College, Moore
          visited many of the London museums, particularly the British Museum,
          which had a wide-ranging collection of ancient sculpture. During these
          visits, he discovered the power and beauty of ancient Egyptian and
          African sculpture. As he became increasingly interested in these
          'primitive' forms of art, he turned away from European sculptural
          traditions.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          After graduating, Moore spent the first six months of 1925 travelling
          in France. When he visited the Trocadero Museum in Paris, he was
          impressed by a cast of a Mayan* sculpture of the rain spirit. It was a
          male reclining figure with its knees drawn up together, and its head
          at a right angle to its body. Moore became fascinated with this stone
          sculpture, which he thought had a power and originality that no other
          stone sculpture possessed. He himself started carving a variety of
          subjects in stone, including depiction of reclining women,
          mother-and-child groups, and masks.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Moore's exceptional talent soon gained recognition, and in 1926 he
          started work as a sculpture instructor at the Royal College. In 1933,
          he became a member of a group of young artists called Unit One. The
          aim of the group was to convince the English public of the merits of
          the emerging international movement in modern art and architecture.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Around this time, Moore moved away from the human figure to experiment
          with abstract shapes. In 1931, he held an exhibition at the Leicester
          Galleries in London. His work was enthusiastically welcomed by fellow
          sculptors, but the reviews in the press were extremely negative and
          turned Moore into a notorious figure. There were calls for his
          resignation from the Royal College, and the following year, when his
          contract expired, he left to start a sculpture department at the
          Chelsea School of Art in London.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Throughout the 1930s, Moore did not show any inclination to please the
          British public. He became interested in the paintings of the Spanish
          artist Pablo Picasso, whose work inspired him to distort the human
          body in a radical way. At times, he seemed to abandon the human figure
          altogether. The pages of his sketchbooks from this period show his
          ideas for abstract sculptures that bore little resemblance to the
          human form.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In 1940, during the Second World War, Moore stopped teaching at the
          Chelsea School and moved to a farmhouse about 20 miles north of
          London. A shortage of materials forced him to focus on drawing. He did
          numerous small sketches of Londoners, later turning these ideas into
          large coloured drawings in his studio. In 1942, he returned to
          Castleford to make a series of sketches of the miners who worked
          there.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In 1944, Harlow, a town near London, offered Moore a commission for a
          sculpture depicting a family. The resulting work signifies a dramatic
          change in Moore's style, away from the experimentation of the 1930s
          towards a more natural and humanistic subject matter. He did dozens of
          studies in clay for the sculpture, and these were cast in bronze and
          issued in editions of seven to nine copies each. In this way, Moore's
          work became available to collectors all over the world. The boost to
          his income enabled him to take on ambitious projects and start working
          on the scale he felt his sculpture demanded.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Critics who had begun to think that Moore had become less
          revolutionary were proven wrong by the appearance, in 1950, of the
          first of Moore's series of standing figures in bronze, with their
          harsh and angular pierced forms and distinct impression of menace.
          Moore also varied his subject matter in the 1950s with such works as{" "}
          <em>Warrior with Shield</em> and <em>Falling Warrior</em>. These were
          rare examples of Moore's use of the male figure and owe something to
          his visit to Greece in 1951, when he had the opportunity to study
          ancient works of art.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In his final years, Moore created the Henry Moore Foundation to
          promote art appreciation and to display his work. Moore was the first
          modern English sculptor to achieve international critical acclaim and
          he is still regarded as one of the most important sculptors of the
          20th century.

          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 14-26</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">
          The Desolenator: producing clean water
        </h3>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Travelling around Thailand in the 1990s, William Janssen was impressed
          with the basic rooftop solar heating systems that were on many homes,
          where energy from the sun was absorbed by a plate and then used to
          heat water for domestic use. Two decades later Janssen developed that
          basic idea he saw in Southeast Asia into a portable device that uses
          the power from the sun to purify water.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Desolenator operates as a mobile desalination unit that can take
          water from different places, such as the sea, rivers, boreholes and
          rain, and purify it for human consumption. It is particularly valuable
          in regions where natural groundwater reserves have been polluted, or
          where seawater is the only water source available.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Janssen saw that there was a need for a sustainable way to clean water
          is both the developing and the developed countries when he moved to
          the United Arab Emirates and saw large-scale water processing. 'I was
          confronted with the enormous carbon footprint that the Gulf nations
          have because of all of the desalination that they do,' he says.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Desolenator can produce 15 litres of drinking water per day,
          enough to sustain a family for cooking and drinking. Its main selling
          point is that unlike standard desalination techniques, it doesn't
          require a generated power supply: just sunlight. It measures 120 cm by
          90 cm, and it easy to transport, thanks to its two wheels. Water
          enters through a pipe, and flows as a thin film between a sheet of
          double glazing and the surface of a solar panel, where it is heated by
          the sun. the warm water flows into a small boiler (heated by a
          solar-powered battery) where it is converted to steam. When the steam
          cools, it becomes distilled water. The device has a very simple filter
          to trap particles, and this can easily be shaken to remove them. There
          are two tubes for liquid coming out: one for the waste – salt from
          seawater, fluoride, etc. – and another for the distilled water. The
          performance of the unit is shown on an LCD screen and transmitted to
          the company which provides servicing when necessary.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A recent analysis found that at least two-thirds of the world's
          population lives with severe water scarcity for at least a month every
          year. Janssen says that be 2030 half of the world's population will be
          living with water stress – where the demand exceeds the supply over a
          certain period of time. 'It is really important that a sustainable
          solution is brought to the market that is able to help these people,'
          he says. Many countries 'don't have the money for desalination plants,
          which are very expensive to build. They don't have the money to
          operate them, they are very maintenance intensive, and they don't have
          the money to buy the diesel to run the desalination plants, so it is a
          really bad situation.'
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The device is aimed at a wide variety of users – from homeowners in
          the developing world who do not have a constant supply of water to
          people living off the grid in rural parts of the US. The first
          commercial versions of the Desolenator are expected to be in operation
          in India early next year, after field tests are carried out. The
          market for the self-sufficient devices in developing countries is
          twofold – those who cannot afford the money for the device outright
          and pay through microfinance, and middle-income homes that can lease
          their own equipment. 'People in India don't pay for a fridge outright;
          they pay for it over six months. They would put the Desolenator on
          their roof and hook it up to their municipal supply and they would get
          very reliable drinking water on a daily basis,' Janssen says. In the
          developed world, it is aimed at niche markets where tap water is
          unavailable – for camping, on boats, or for the military, for
          instance.

          Prices will vary according to where it is bought. In the developing
          world, the price will depend on what deal aid organisations can
          negotiate. In developed countries, it is likely to come in at $1,000
          (£685) a unit, said Janssen. 'We are a venture with a social mission.
          We are aware that the product we have envisioned is mainly finding
          application in the developing world and humanitarian sector and that
          this is the way we will proceed. We do realise, though, that to be a
          viable company there is a bottom line to keep in mind,' he says.

        <p className="mb-4">
          The company itself is based at Imperial College London, although
          Janssen, its chief executive, still lives in the UAE. It has raised
          £340,000 in funding so far. Within two years, he says, the company
          aims to be selling 1,000 units a month, mainly in the humanitarian
          field. They are expected to be sold in areas such as Australia,
          northern Chile, Peru, Texas and California.

        <p className="mb-2">

          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">
          Why fairy tales are really scary tales
        </h3>

        <p className="italic mb-4">
          Some people think that fairy tales are just stories to amuse children,
          but their universal and enduring appeal may be due to more serious
          reasons
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          People of every culture tell each other fairy tales but the same story
          often takes a variety of forms in different parts of the world. In the
          story of <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> that European children are
          familiar with, a young girl on the way to see her grandmother meets a
          wolf and tells him where she is going. The wolf runs on ahead and
          disposes of the grandmother, then gets into bed dressed in the
          grandmother's clothes to wait for Little Red Riding Hood. You may
          think you know the story – but which version? In some versions, the
          wolf swallows up the grandmother, while in others it locks her in a
          cupboard. In some stories Red Riding Hood gets the better of the wolf
          on her own, while in others a hunter or a woodcutter hears her cries
          and comes to her rescue.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The universal appeal of these tales is frequently attributed to the
          idea that they contain cautionary messages: in the case of{" "}
          <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em>, to listen to your mother, and avoid
          talking to strangers. 'It might be what we find interesting about this
          story is that it's got this survival-relevant information in it,' says
          anthropologist Jamie Tehrani at Durham University in the UK. But his
          research suggests otherwise. 'We have this huge gap in our knowledge
          about the history and prehistory of storytelling, despite the fact
          that we know this genre is an incredibly ancient one,' he says. That
          hasn't stopped anthropologists, folklorists* and other academics
          devising theories to explain the importance of fairy tales in human
          society. Now Tehrani has found a way to test these ideas, borrowing a
          technique from evolutionary biologists.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          To work out the evolutionary history, development and relationships
          among groups of organisms, biologists compare the characteristics of
          living species in a process called 'phylogenetic analysis'. Tehrani
          has used the same approach to compare related versions of fairy tales
          to discover how they have evolved and which elements have survived
          longest.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Tehrani's analysis focused on <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> in its
          many forms, which include another Western fairy tale known as{" "}
          <em>The Wolf and the Kids</em>. Checking for variants of these two
          tales and similar stories from Africa, East Asia and other regions, he
          ended up with 58 stories recorded from oral traditions. Once his
          phylogenetic analysis had established that they were indeed related,
          he used the same methods to explore how they have developed and
          altered over time.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          First he tested some assumptions about which aspects of the story
          alter least as it evolves, indicating their importance. Folklorists
          believe that what happens in a story is more central to the story than
          the characters in it – that visiting a relative, only to be met by a
          scary animal in disguise, is more fundamental than whether the visitor
          is a little girl or three siblings, or the animal is a tiger instead
          of a wolf.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          However, Tehrani found no significant difference in the rate of
          evolution of incidents compared with that of characters. 'Certain
          episodes are very stable because they are crucial to the story, but
          there are lots of other details that can evolve quite freely,' he
          says. Neither did his analysis support the theory that the central
          section of a story is the most conserved part. He found no significant
          difference in the flexibility of events there compared with the
          beginning or the end.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But the really big surprise came when he looked at the cautionary
          elements of the story. 'Studies on hunter-gatherer folk tales suggest
          that these narratives include really important information about the
          environment and the possible dangers that may be faced there – stuff
          that's relevant to survival,' he says. Yet in his analysis such
          elements were just as flexible as seemingly trivial details. What,
          then, is important enough to be reproduced from generation to
          generation?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The answer, it would appear, is fear – blood-thirsty and gruesome
          aspects of the story, such as the eating of the grandmother by the
          wolf, turned out to be the best preserved of all. Why are these
          details retained by generations of storytellers, when other features
          are not? Tehrani has an idea: 'In an oral context, a story won't
          survive because of one great teller. It also needs to be interesting
          when it's told by someone who's not necessarily a great storyteller.'
          Maybe being swallowed whole by a wolf, then cut out of its stomach
          alive is so gripping that it helps the story remain popular, no matter
          how badly it's told.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Jack Zipes at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, is unconvinced
          by Tehrani's views on fairy tales. 'Even if they're gruesome, they
          won't stick unless they matter,' he says. He believes the perennial
          theme of women as victims in stories like{" "}
          <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> explains why they continue to feel
          relevant. But Tehrani points out that although this is often the case
          in Western versions, it is not always true elsewhere. In Chinese and
          Japanese versions, often known as <em>The Tiger Grandmother</em>, the
          villain is a woman, and in both Iran and Nigeria, the victim is a boy.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Mathias Clasen at Aarhus University in Denmark isn't surprised by
          Tehrani's findings. 'Habits and morals change, but the things that
          scare us, and the fact that we seek out entertainment that's designed
          to scare us – those are constant,' he says. Clasen believes that scary
          stories teach us what it feels like to be afraid without having to
          experience real danger, and so build up resistance to negative
          emotions.
