        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">The History of Glass</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Whether Roman, Islamic, Byzantine, Venetian, Dutch, English, Bohemian, Chinese, Irish, or American, glass has a long history. The quality varies greatly, though, which means that dating glass can be difficult. There is a lot we do not know about the history of glass. In spite of thorough research in recent years, our knowledge of the materials used and the techniques employed, especially in the ancient world, is still not what we would wish.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Everyone knows what glass is. We'd define it as a solid material, more or less transparent, but there's a problem here: glass is actually a liquid, though an unusual one that seems to behave as a solid. At room temperature, atoms in a typical liquid can rearrange themselves fully in about 10<sup>-11</sup> seconds, but they cannot rearrange themselves in ordinary glass in any length of time – or at least, the length of time would be longer than the earth has existed. Glass is in a frozen, liquid state.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Glass is one of our oldest materials. Natural glasses can be found in various forms across the world. They include obsidian, a black volcanic glass; fulgurites, long glassy tubes produced when lightning strikes sand; and tektites, probably formed when a large meteorite strikes the earth. Natural glasses have been used since the Stone Age for making tools, arrow tips, jewellery and money.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The first manufactured glass appeared around 5000 years ago. The skills of glassmaking and glass-colouring were probably discovered through pottery. The earliest manufactured glass objects from Egypt, long thought to date from the 4th millennium B.C., may actually be waste products from some form of metalworking. The earliest dates for manufactured glass are from around 2500 B.C., and it is generally agreed that the first manufactured glass objects were beads. Early glassmaking was centred in Western Asia, Crete and Egypt.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In the beginning, glass was extremely valuable. However, in the 1st century A.D., the discovery of glass-blowing techniques made it more available. Glassmaking spread to the Roman Empire, and the Romans used it for containers, windows, and decorative objects. The Roman historian Pliny tells the story that glass was first discovered by Phoenician sailors: according to his account, they landed on a beach, made a cooking fire using some natron (soda) they had brought with them as cargo, and noticed the white-hot combination of fire, sand and natron resulted in streams of molten glass (we now know that temperatures of at least 1000°C would be required). However, this is now considered a myth. The Roman writer Seneca described how glass-blowers worked in his time, while the geographer Strabo wrote in the 1st century A.D. that the clear glass most valued by Romans came from a glassmaking area of the Middle East.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          After the collapse of the Roman Empire in the 5th century A.D., the centre of European glass manufacturing moved to Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire. In the 10th and 11th centuries, stained glass for church windows developed as a major art form in northern Europe. From the 13th century onwards, glass factories in Venice began to develop the technologies that would make Venetian glass among the finest in the world. It was made from soda ash, derived from the burning of certain marine plants, rather than from the potash used in the forests of northern Europe. The soda ash gave Venetian glass stability and clarity. In the 1600s some glass workers left Venice for France and England, spreading Venetian glassmaking techniques.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          By the 1600s the glass trade had thoroughly established itself in Europe. Windows and mirrors were in great demand, and the sizes being made were increasing. A typical early 17th century London window was made of small panes leaded together; by the mid-century many could afford bigger windows with larger panes. However, the industry was held back by the cost of fuel for the furnaces, and was regarded suspiciously because of the risk of fire; as a result, glassmaking was banned within the city limits of some large towns. The greatest changes in the industry came with the industrial revolution in the late 18th century, which led to the development of automatic glass-pressing machines that could make standardised items. Glass suddenly received more uses and became much more common.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The 19th century saw the great age of Victorian public buildings with huge glass windows, and glass was simultaneously being used to create massive hothouses for fruit and exotic plants. By the late 19th century, glass was being used in buildings to allow form to follow function, a feature of the new architecture. The Crystal Palace exhibition hall of 1851 was revolutionary, a building without load-bearing walls, made entirely from iron and glass: enclosing not just people but trees as well. The development in the 1870s of the plate glass production process, using molten glass, led to the use of glass in department stores and office buildings. The 20th century saw glass used increasingly as a construction material.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          New construction techniques, using steel frames and pillar supports, had encouraged the American architect Louis Sullivan, in the 1880s and 1890s, to use large amounts of glass in his pioneering skyscrapers. This led to the development of a new architectural language of simplicity and light, using glass as a fundamental material. Flight, speed, faith in an optimistic future powered by machines: these new ideas influenced such European architects as Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier. With glass, it seemed, they could build idealised environments, hygienic, full of light, but separate from the world. With the arrival of the air-conditioned skyscraper, it would be possible to work in a glass bubble never touched by the imperfections of reality. When American cultural and technological optimism swept the world after 1945, glass-walled skyscrapers would be the most obvious symbols of it.

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">The Triune Brain</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The first serious attempts to locate mental functions in the brain were made in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, when the science of 'phrenology' briefly captured the public imagination. Phrenology was based on the idea that individual mental functions were located in specific parts of the brain, and that this would be reflected in bumps on the skull. The practitioner would feel the bumps on a person's skull, and on this basis make pronouncements about that person's character: timid or bold, studious or adventurous, trustworthy or criminal in their tendencies. For this reason, phrenology was popular as a way of assessing candidates for jobs. For instance, the process was reportedly used by the East India Company during the selection of officers, and by some prison authorities in order to determine which convicts were trustworthy enough to be given tasks such as working in the prison kitchen.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In the twentieth century, more objective scientific methods replaced this strange practice, but some of the basic assumptions of phrenology were vindicated. Thus, it has been discovered that the brain has many separate modules. Speech is mainly controlled by a module in the left hemisphere (near the front for production of speech and further back for speech perception), while visual perceptions are handled at the back of the brain in the occipital lobe. For more information about the anatomy of the brain, see Figure 1.

        </div>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In the 1960s, the American physician and neuroscientist Paul MacLean devised a highly influential model of brain evolution, which became known as the 'triune brain' (meaning 'three-in-one brain'). According to MacLean's model, the human brain has evolved over time, gradually accumulating new structures and functions, so that it now consists of three brains in one. The oldest part, which he called the 'reptilian complex' or 'R-complex', was said to have evolved several hundred million years ago when reptiles became the dominant animals on Earth. It consists of the basal ganglia (groups of nerve cells around the thalamus) and the brain stem (the enlarged top of the spinal cord, sometimes called the 'midbrain'). MacLean believed that these brain regions behave like a reptile: cold-blooded and driven entirely by the instinct for self-preservation.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The second evolutionary arrival was the paleomammalian (or 'old-mammal') brain, now usually called the 'limbic system'. This is a complex network of structures located just behind the cerebral cortex, and includes the hippocampus, hypothalamus and amygdala. Apart from its role in emotion, the limbic system is believed to process memories, particularly memories relating to experiences of an emotional nature. For example, it determines whether our memories of a significant event, such as our first job interview, are experienced as pleasurable or anxiety-provoking.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The most recent addition to the brain's anatomy was the neocortex (also called the neomammalian or 'new-mammal' brain), which is the outer layer of the cerebral cortex – a sheet of neural tissue surrounding most of the brain. In most mammals, the neocortex is smooth, but in humans it is extremely convoluted, with ridges (called gyri) and valleys (called sulci). The neocortex is associated with the development of 'higher' cognitive skills, such as language, logical reasoning and forward planning. All three parts of the triune brain communicate with one another, but they are sufficiently separate in their functioning for MacLean to have described them as 'three interconnected biological computers'.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In the early days of brain science, the focus was on finding which parts of the brain performed which tasks. The excitement of the early findings (such as Broca's discovery of a small area of the cortex that plays a key role in speech production) created the impression that the brain is neatly organised as a collection of components, each responsible for a separate function. However, as we have learned more about the brain, we have moved away from this simple idea of 'modularity'. We can instead see that most mental functions involve many parts of the brain. For example, language is usually associated with the left hemisphere, but the right hemisphere is now recognised as contributing to the emotional content of speech. And so, the idea of a 'language module' is not exactly false, but it is a simplification of the reality.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          MacLean's triune brain theory was a bold attempt to provide a unifying theory of the human mind, linking our evolutionary history to our modern-day mental capacities and emotions. It has been extremely successful as a metaphor, and the 'reptilian brain' in particular has a firm hold on the popular imagination. However, while the science of the triune brain was innovative in its time, modern neuroscientists now regard it as outdated in a number of respects. For instance, the idea of the brain as divided into three discrete parts was rather too simplistic. A small brain region known as the basal ganglia, located in the forebrain, has circuits connecting it to many other brain regions (including the neocortex). The theory presented this structure as part of an early 'reptile' brain, unrelated to the more recent evolution of the cortex; this is now known to be incorrect. And there are structures in the limbic system which are unique to humans or highly developed primates – not 'old-mammalian' at all. Furthermore, research has shown that emotions involve both cortical and subcortical brain structures. Thus, anger is not purely a function of a 'primitive' limbic system but is generated by a complex interaction of limbic, neocortical and brainstem regions.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In fact, MacLean's view of evolution was quite inaccurate. He saw it as a linear process, in which species become increasingly complex and sophisticated over time. Modern evolutionary theory emphasises that evolution is not a matter of 'higher' and 'lower' animals, but only of those that have successfully adapted to their environments. Rather than a linear 'chain of being', evolution follows a complex branching pattern, with each species evolving to adapt to its ecological niche, sometimes becoming more complex and sometimes becoming simpler. For example, flightless birds are not 'less evolved' than other birds – they simply adapted to an ecological niche where flight was not a useful feature.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          MacLean's model has also come in for criticism in that it represents a form of Cartesian dualism. The philosopher René Descartes argued that humans consist of a material body and a non-material mind or soul. In spite of its reference to neural anatomy, MacLean's theory was arguably a disguised form of dualism in that it envisaged the brain as the meeting place of separate neural components, which are locked in perpetual conflict. This is not so different from Descartes' belief that the human mind is the scene of struggle between 'animal passions' and 'rational powers'.

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>, which
          are based on Reading Passage 3 below.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">Measuring Organizational Performance</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The tradition of performance measurement goes back a long way. In the past, organisations attempted to measure performance in financial terms, and they used measures like return on investment, profit and turnover. In the 1980s there was growing dissatisfaction with the use of financial performance measures. Critics claimed that they were lagging indicators. In other words, they tell you how well you have done, but not how well you are doing, or are likely to do. This means they are of limited use for strategic decisions affecting the future direction of the company.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In the early 1990s, Robert Kaplan and David Norton introduced a new approach to performance measurement. They recognised that managers need a balanced set of performance indicators, covering the financial and non-financial aspects of the business. In particular, managers need to be able to view performance in several areas simultaneously. This is the strength of the Balanced Scorecard. Kaplan and Norton identify four areas, which they call perspectives: financial, customer, internal business process, and learning and growth. The idea is that looking at all four perspectives helps managers to view the performance of the company as a whole. This helps them to check that good performance in one aspect of the business is not being used to hide, or is not coming at the cost of, poor performance in another aspect.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In earlier times, focusing solely on financial measures was sufficient for a rather stable business environment. But in a more complex global business arena, finding a wider set of ways to judge how well your business is doing is critical. The financial performance of a business continues to be fundamental. The new approach was not suggesting that the financial elements of a business should be ignored; rather, it suggested that they should be part of a wider set of performance indicators. The Balanced Scorecard complements the financial measures with operational measures of customer satisfaction, internal business processes, and the organisation's innovation and improvement activities. These operational measures are the drivers of future financial performance.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Of course, academics and the professional accounting bodies have debated the merits of the Balanced Scorecard. Some argue that the benefits, particularly in relation to devising an operational management tool of use to implementers, are not easily realisable in practice. Kaplan and Norton suggested that the four perspectives they put forward are a clear and useful guide for managers. But they do not claim that these four perspectives are sufficient for all organisations. For example, service companies may wish to emphasise a customer relationship perspective, while a company whose source of innovation is people will want to use a human resource perspective. Kaplan and Norton also do not claim that the Balanced Scorecard is static. They emphasise that it should be adjusted as the business develops. For example, a company that starts up with a limited product range aimed at a clearly identified market will focus on financial measures at first. As it develops different products and expands its customer base, the emphasis should shift to customer acquisition and retention, along with measures of innovation and product development.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Balanced Scorecard is essentially a top-down approach that is driven from the organisation's strategy. The emphasis is on translating the organisation's strategy and vision into a series of interrelated performance measures. Translating strategic vision is crucial because it forces managers to agree on what they are trying to achieve, and how they are trying to achieve it. It is no coincidence that businesses use the language of vision, mission and strategy, with the idea that leaders should have clear understanding of where they are leading the company. Confusingly, some strategies emerge from the day-to-day decisions taken within organisations, rather than being the result of a formal strategy-making process.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Another issue in using the Balanced Scorecard is identifying appropriate measures. While Kaplan and Norton stress the need for a company to focus on a few critical measures, the measures they identify in what they describe as 'a balanced scorecard for a manufacturing company' might be considered numerous. When setting up a Balanced Scorecard, organisations have to select measures that are most relevant to their changing strategies, particularly at a corporate level, where up to 25 measures across the four perspectives might be considered necessary. But at the operational level, up to 10 or 15 measures in the four areas of the Balanced Scorecard, although sometimes unwieldy, might be appropriate.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In developing a Balanced Scorecard, it is necessary to introduce appropriate performance targets or benchmarks. Kaplan and Norton describe how a company in electronic circuit manufacturing has a benchmark of zero for soldering defects, but also a medium-term target level of 1.5 defects for each circuit board with 1,000 opportunities for soldering defects. Identifying a target or benchmark is not as simple as it might seem, especially when the benchmark has to be changed. In this example, if the benchmark is zero, then identifying a new benchmark may be viewed as a failure. But identifying a medium-term target that should be achievable enables the company to show progress towards the goal of zero defects.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          A key outcome from a Balanced Scorecard is that it helps communicate the organisation's strategy. The importance of communication is highlighted in a study that said less than 5% of employees understood their organisation's strategy, that less than 25% of managers had incentives linked to the strategy, and that 60% of organisations did not link budgets to the strategy. If employees do not know what the strategy is, they are unlikely to be able to work towards implementing it. By using the Balanced Scorecard to report performance in several areas, managers are describing the company strategy. It also helps to make employees aware of operational goals. Employees at all levels become aware of the key business drivers, for instance the important measures of customer satisfaction, and can then direct their energies to areas in which improvements will help the competitive position of the firm. In this way, performance measures are used to signal to all employees what factors are critical to the organisation.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Some organisations have been sufficiently impressed with the Balanced Scorecard approach to use it to monitor and guide strategic implementation. The aim is to translate strategy into operational measures in order to monitor implementation. As circumstances change, the strategy may need to be revised. The feedback from the Balanced Scorecard permits managers to test whether their strategy is working as they intended. If the feedback shows that it is not, it enables the company to modify the strategy. This becomes a learning process that managers can use to test the assumptions and theories about their organisation's strategy.
