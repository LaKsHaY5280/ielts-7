        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Cycle lights</h3>
        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">
          What are the legal requirements?
        </h4>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          You must have approved front and rear lights that are lit, clean and
          working properly when cycling between sunset and sunrise. It's no
          defence to say that it was past sunset but not yet dark. The legal
          lighting obligations for cyclists are determined by sunset and sunrise
          times — not the 'hours of darkness', which start 30 minutes after the
          former, end 30 minutes before the latter and dictate when motorists
          must switch from sidelights to headlights.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Cycling UK's guide to cycling regulations explains the Road Vehicles
          Lighting Regulations in detail, but in summary you need a white light
          at the front and a red light at the rear, visible from the front and
          rear respectively and fixed to your bike. A light obscured by a
          saddlebag isn't legal and neither is a torch on your head, though
          there's nothing to stop you using a head-torch as an additional light.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The regulations also now allow flashing lights, provided they flash
          between 60 and 240 times per minute. The legal requirements for
          reflectors include a red rear reflector and four amber pedal
          reflectors, one at the front and rear of each pedal. Common sense
          might suggest that a reflective heel strip or ankle band could replace
          an amber pedal reflector, but unfortunately these do not meet the
          legal requirements. This is an annoying problem for riders who use
          bikes where the feet are attached to the pedals and cannot slip. These
          pedals are not designed with enough space to accommodate reflectors
          and make this an area of legislation in need of change.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Unlike with other vehicles, lights are not a legal requirement for
          cyclists when there is seriously reduced visibility during the
          daytime, although we wouldn't recommend cycling through dense fog
          without lighting up.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">
          Maintaining a safe environment for employees working on computers
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Under health and safety law, you must ensure that the working
          environment meets certain minimum requirements
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Workstation furniture</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The work desk or work surface should be big enough to allow the user
          to arrange the screen, keyboard and documents, etc. in a flexible way.
          It should be stable and positioned so that it's comfortable when an
          employee uses a document holder, but also big enough to let the user
          work comfortably and to alter their position.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">The working environment</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          You need to assess noise levels. The equipment shouldn't be so noisy
          that it distracts the user. If you can't use quieter equipment,
          consider soundproofing or moving the equipment. You could use
          partitions between noisy equipment and the rest of the workstation as
          an alternative.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Lighting is also an important consideration. Surrounding windows must
          have curtains or blinds which users can adjust to prevent reflected
          glare. If needed, provide users with lighting appropriate to their
          tasks and particular workstation. Users should have control over their
          lighting to prevent reflected glare.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Temperature-wise, the equipment should not give out so much heat that
          the user becomes uncomfortable, so monitor this. It's also important
          that you maintain ventilation, and you control humidity so that it is
          at a level which keeps the user comfortable.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Task design and rest breaks</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Good design of the task can be as important as the right choice of
          furniture and equipment. Whenever possible you should design jobs so
          that employees have a mix of activities and some control over which
          tasks they perform and when. You should match staffing levels to
          workload so that individuals are neither overworked nor underworked
          and give employees some say in the way work is carried out and the
          planning that goes into it.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          An employee's need for rest breaks will vary depending on the type of
          work they are doing and how intensely they are working. As a general
          rule, however, short, frequent breaks are better than longer, less
          frequent ones. A 5-10-minute break after 50-60 minutes' work is better
          than a 15-20-minute break after two hours. The employee should, at
          times, have a choice over when to take breaks and they should be
          encouraged to do non-work activities during their break, ideally away
          from the workstation.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Using portable ladders</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Workers use portable ladders for a variety of jobs outside, such as
          first- and second-floor window cleaning and building repairs
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Employers need to oversee all ladders that are owned by their company.
          Detailed visual inspections should be carried out on a regular basis,
          and they should have an up-to-date record of these. Before starting a
          job, employers are also responsible for ensuring any ladder is the
          right length to meet the needs of the task; reaching out from the very
          top of a ladder is highly dangerous. Once you get a ladder, you, as
          user of the ladder, should conduct a pre-use check each working day.
          Conducting pre-use checks should have been part of your training and
          should be done in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines. When
          doing a check, it is important to focus on the steps and make sure
          they are not loose as this could cause an accident. Similarly, a
          cracked joint in the ladder could cause it to fail.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Almost all falls from ladders happen because the ladder moves
          unexpectedly. The key factor in preventing falls from ladders is to
          ensure your ladder is stable whilst being used. First, make sure that
          you choose level ground on which to set up your ladder. There are
          specially designed tools you can use to ensure this — don't just use a
          piece of wood. Second, check the ground surface is dirt-free and
          solid, so the feet can grip and the ladder doesn't sink.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Before you go up your ladder, look at the surrounding environment.
          Make sure the ladder cannot be struck by vehicles. If necessary,
          safeguard the area by placing red and white cones around it. Ensure it
          will not be pushed over by other hazards such as opening doors. Doors
          and windows may need to be secured where possible. Finally, think
          about the hazards to the general public and make sure they cannot walk
          underneath it or get too near to it. A 'danger' sign at the base is
          often the best way of doing this.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          To secure the ladder, tie it to a suitable point, such as a window or
          railing, making sure both sides are attached. Where this is not
          practical, secure it to the wall near the base of the ladder with
          ties; avoid using blocks to wedge the ladder in place as they can
          easily move.

          The story of the Fosbury Flop
        </h3>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          On October 20, 1968, a 21-year-old university student from the USA
          called Dick Fosbury completely transformed the sport of high jumping
          with a gold-medal and Olympic-record jump of 2.24 meters at the Mexico
          City games. Fosbury accomplished this fabulous feat by sailing over
          the crossbar head first and backward! As colorfully described that day
          by the Los Angeles Times, "Fosbury goes over the bar like a guy being
          pushed out of a 30-story window."
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          At first, when asked about how this unorthodox maneuver originated,
          Fosbury would joke with sportswriters, informing some that, because of
          his university background in physics and engineering, he had initially
          designed the Flop on paper, and telling others that he had
          accidentally discovered this technique when he once tripped and fell
          backward on his take-off. However, in later interviews, Fosbury
          revealed that the technique actually unfolded over many years and
          involved countless trials and errors. "It was simply a natural
          technique that evolved," he said. "I never thought about how to change
          it, and I'm sure my coach was going crazy because it kept evolving. I
          didn't know anyone else in the world would be able to use it."
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Fosbury explained that when he first learned to high jump at the age
          of 10 or 11, he tried jumping with the "scissors" style. He said, "I
          used that style until I went into high school, where my coach
          explained that I was never going to get anywhere with that technique.
          He started me with the 'belly roll' technique. However, I was really
          lousy with that style. I expressed my frustration to coach and he said
          that if I really wanted, I could still use the 'scissors'."
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          So, in his next competition, Fosbury went back to the "scissors"
          style. He explained: "As the bar was raised each time, I began to lift
          my hips up and my shoulders went back in reaction to that. At the end
          of the competition, I had improved my best by 15 cm to 1 m 78 and even
          placed third! The next two years in high school with my curved
          approach, I began to lead with my shoulder and eventually was going
          over head first like today's floppers."
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          In this way, the Flop evolved, not from design, but from a
          trial-and-error process which combined repeated effort with the
          biomechanics of Fosbury's gangling 1 m 93 physique. Sports Illustrated
          writer Richard Hoffer wrote: "It was on-site engineering, his body and
          mind working together, making reflexive adjustments with only one
          goal, getting over the bar." Hoffer explained that although Fosbury's
          arms and legs seemed to be all over the place, those movements that
          served to get him a centimeter higher were retained, while the others
          were gradually eliminated as the technique evolved.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          What did Fosbury think of the seeming awkwardness of his Flop? "I
          believe that the Flop was a natural style," he said, "And I was just
          the first to find it. I can say that because the Canadian jumper
          Debbie Brill was a few years younger than I was and also developed the
          same technique only a few years after me and without ever having seen
          me."
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          A striking coincidence? Yes indeed. But perhaps not as striking as the
          fact that a high school student called Bruce Quande was photographed
          on May 24, 1963 flopping backward over the crossbar. This was the same
          month that Fosbury recalls having flopped for the first time in the
          competition when he was at high school.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          But completing the Flop successfully was only half the battle the
          return to earth still had to be negotiated. Few would even consider
          such an experiment knowing they had to land on their necks. When
          Fosbury was jumping in high school he had to land in pits which were
          filled with wood chips, sawdust or sand. On one occasion Fosbury hit
          his head on the wooden border of the pit. Another time he landed
          totally out of the pit, flat on his back knocking the wind out of him.
          The next year Fosbury's high school became the first in the region to
          install foam rubber in its high jump pit thereby cushioning the
          jumper's fall and encouraging the use of the potentially dangerous
          Flop. The Fosbury Flop and cushioned landing areas thus appear to have
          co-evolved.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">G</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Fosbury explains how he came to name the Flop. "I am very proud that I
          received the naming rights. But the term by which the style is known
          did not appear overnight. To tell the truth the first time was that I
          was interviewed and asked 'What do you call this?' I used my
          engineering analytical side and I referred to it as a 'back layout.'
          It was not interesting and the journalist didn't even write it down. I
          noted this. The next time that I was interviewed that's when I said:
          'Well at home in my town they call it the Fosbury Flop' – and everyone
          wrote it down. I was the first time to call it that but it came from a
          caption on a newspaper photo that said: 'Fosbury flops over bar.' The
          context was that our town was on a river, very popular for fishing an
          hour from the Pacific Ocean. And when you land a fish on the bank it's
          flopping. That's the action and so it's a good description by a
          journalist and I remembered it."
