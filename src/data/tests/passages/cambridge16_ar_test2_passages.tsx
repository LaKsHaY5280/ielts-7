        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">The White Horse of Uffington</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The cutting of huge figures or geoglyphs into the earth of English
          hillsides has been going on for more than 3,000 years. There are 56
          hill figures scattered around England, with the vast majority on the
          chalk downlands of the southwest. The Uffington White Horse in
          Oxfordshire is the most famous example. It lies on the Berkshire
          Downs, a part of the North Wessex Downs, just below the Iron Age
          hill-fort known as Uffington Castle and above a deep valley called the
          Manger. The figure is formed from deep trenches filled with crushed
          white chalk, and is presumed to represent a horse shown in profile,
          although it has also been called a dragon.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          It was first documented in the 12th century and was previously thought
          to have been constructed during the Iron Age (800 BCE-100 CE) or in
          the early Anglo-Saxon period, but in 1995, the figure was dated by the
          Oxford Archaeological Unit using a technique called optical stimulated
          luminescence (OSL). OSL can be used to identify when the quartz
          sediments were last exposed to sunlight. The results produced a date
          range between 1400 and 600 BCE, putting it in the Late Bronze Age.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The figure has been maintained throughout its long history by periodic
          scouring of the turf and chalk infill. This is known as the 'Scouring
          of the White Horse', and was carried out at intervals of between 7 and
          20 years. The cleaning process has always been a major local event
          with a fair and various entertainments. Local records from 1763 refer
          to a tradition of regular work on the figure, and a 'Pastime' festival
          that accompanied it. The importance of cleaning the Horse was
          emphasised when a thin layer of turf was allowed to grow over the
          figure during World War II so that the location of the Horse could not
          be used for navigation by enemy bombers. After the war, the withered
          remains of the turf were cleared away and the Horse was resurfaced.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There have been several well-documented scourings over the centuries.
          For example, Francis Wise wrote in 1736: 'The ceremony of scouring the
          Horse, from time immemorial, has been solemnized by a numerous
          concourse of people from all the villages roundabout.' In 1780, a
          newspaper reported details of the scouring and the traditional
          festivities that accompanied it, including cheese rolling and
          wrestling for a cake. In 2000, English Heritage took the unusual step
          of commissioning a complete cleaning of the figure. The cleaning
          process took several days. Specialist teams cleaned off all the
          discolouration, slightly enlarged the figure to match more closely the
          archaeological findings of the survey, and then re-chalked it using
          160 tonnes of new chalk from a nearby mine. The reason for the
          cleaning by English Heritage, apart from the historic tradition, is to
          keep the chalk surface exposed, making it harder for plants to gain a
          foothold, and therefore ensuring that the Horse remains clearly
          visible from afar.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Many geoglyphs have been made in the last 300 years as memorials,
          advertisements, or simply follies or jokes. The earliest were copies
          of the Uffington White Horse and occurred within Berkshire itself, but
          by the 1860s, new ones were being cut in Yorkshire and the southwest,
          as well as in Berkshire. Most of the new geoglyphs are in the form of
          horses. One of these is the Westbury White Horse, which has been
          changed over the years. In the 1950s, the horse was painted over with
          white concrete with the intention of reducing the need for future
          maintenance. But the disadvantage of this kind of solid outline is
          that weeds find it easier to grow in the cracks, and the edges become
          blurred with the passage of time.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Other notable geoglyphs include the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset, and
          the Long Man of Wilmington, Sussex. Experts are still debating whether
          some of them are genuinely ancient, or were originally created in the
          last 300-400 years. The majority of white horses date from the 18th
          and 19th centuries. There was a fascination with the Uffington Horse,
          and many villages wanted their own version. At least 24 of these white
          horses are known to have existed. Wiltshire has the highest density of
          white horses, with at least 13.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Not everyone approves of these 'modern' works, but the authorities
          which control building and development works have been uneven in their
          willingness to approve or to remove them. In Kent, for example, an
          image of a horse cut by volunteers to mark the millennium was
          criticised by conservation officers as a 'scar' on the countryside.
          But early in 1999, the Army created one of the most interesting modern
          geoglyphs, a kiwi, the emblem of New Zealand. A group of soldiers from
          New Zealand, stationed in England, carved the image of the kiwi on
          Beacon Hill above the military town of Bulford on the edge of
          Salisbury Plain. Although it was not approved in advance, the Army has
          decided to keep the kiwi and has even built steps to allow visitors to
          view it.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Even though there is plenty of historical evidence for the ancient
          origin of the Uffington Horse, many theories have been proposed to
          explain the origin of the carving. Before the dating of the Uffington
          Horse, it was generally believed that it was first created in the
          Anglo-Saxon period (410-1066), but this is now known to be incorrect.
          Among the range of ideas put forward, one writer even suggested that
          the figure was not a horse or dragon, but a dog. However, almost all
          researchers now accept that it is a horse – a horse seen from above.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          All the horse figures are somewhat stylised, and not proportioned like
          real-life horses, but the Uffington carving is particularly abstract
          and distant from literal representation. It is likely that it was
          originally even more impressive than it appears today. First, when
          freshly cut, it would have been visible from a much greater distance.
          Its position on the steep slope would have emphasised the figure when
          seen from below. This visual impact is especially important given that
          the Horse is best viewed from directly opposite, rather than from
          above. Secondly, the original carvers of the Horse would not have to
          be concerned about making it anatomically correct; all they would have
          needed to do was to produce a convincing impression, and they
          certainly managed to do that.

          Silbo Gomero – the whistle 'language' of the Canary Islands
        </h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          La Gomera, one of the Canary Islands situated off the northwest coast
          of Africa, is home to a remarkable cultural phenomenon: a whistled
          'language' known as Silbo Gomero which is now enjoying a renewal of
          interest. For centuries, the inhabitants of this small island have
          communicated across the deep valleys and ravines that radiate out from
          the island's central mountains by whistling to each other. This
          whistling sound can travel up to 8 miles, much further than shouting,
          and was used to pass messages and news between widely-separated
          villages.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The origins of this whistled language are obscure. There is general
          agreement that it existed before the arrival of the Spanish, who
          conquered the Canary Islands in the 15th century. The original
          inhabitants of the islands were the Guanches, a group of white-skinned
          people related to the North African Berbers. Some researchers have
          claimed that the whistle language was also used in other parts of
          Berber North Africa, supporting the theory of its ancient origins.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Spanish conquerors took only 80 years to wipe out the original
          Guanche language and enforce the use of Spanish. Remarkably, though,
          the Guanches' whistle language survived, by being adapted to Spanish.
          It was widely used throughout the island until the 1950s, when a range
          of economic and social factors began to endanger its survival. Many
          Gomerans were forced by drought and economic hardship to emigrate to
          Venezuela and other Latin American countries. Others moved to nearby
          Tenerife, or shifted to the island's main town, San Sebastian, in
          search of work. Road building, the spread of telephone networks, and
          transistor radios all contributed to its decline. Once a feature of
          daily life, increasingly it was only in remote areas and among the
          elderly that silbadores (whistlers) could be found.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The language of Silbo Gomero has survived in the form in which we find
          it today largely because of the creation of schools for Silbo in the
          1990s. In 1997, Silbo Gomero came to the attention of Dr Ramon
          Trujillo of the University of La Laguna in Tenerife. His subsequent
          studies emphasised that Silbo was a complex whistled language that
          could convey any message, not simply a set of signals with a limited
          range of meanings, like military bugle calls, for example. A language
          which enables a vocabulary of more than 500 words to be whistled
          clearly and understood is a remarkable achievement. Following this
          research, the island government, El Cabildo Insular de la Gomera,
          launched a campaign to save Silbo Gomero from extinction and preserve
          this unique cultural treasure.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In 1999, Silbo Gomero was introduced as a compulsory subject in
          primary schools throughout the island. Since then, it has been taught
          to over 3,000 children, although it is not clear how many have
          persevered and become proficient whistlers; research has shown that it
          takes about two years to speak Silbo well. This revival, together with
          the development of tourism in the Canary Islands, means that most
          Gomerans now regard Silbo as a matter of pride, not shame. A whistling
          demonstration is a regular part of the floor show in restaurants, and
          competitions and championships are held each year. In 2009, the
          language was placed on the UNESCO Representative List of the
          Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          How does 'speaking' by whistling work? Normal human speech uses a
          combination of vowel sounds, created by the vocal cords and modified
          by the tongue and soft palate, and consonants made by restricting
          airflow with the tongue or lips etc. In order to cover adequate ranges
          of these very different types of sound, whistling uses a simple but
          effective substitution. The four vowels of Spanish become just two
          whistled vowels, and the range of consonants is correspondingly
          reduced, although not quite so drastically. A crucial feature of
          Silbo's effectiveness is that, when whistled, very different Spanish
          words sound identical. The word for 'house' (casa) sounds the same as
          the word for 'hunting' (caza), for example. In practice, however, this
          is not a problem as the context of the conversation usually makes it
          quite clear which meaning is intended.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Dr Michelle Cuskley, a researcher, wanted to see just how well
          first-time listeners with no previous experience of Silbo could
          understand it. She presented 39 Spaniards from Madrid with recordings
          of silbadores whistling 215 Spanish sentences. Results were variable,
          with some subjects guessing the meaning correctly quite often, while
          others struggled. A score of 38.6% accuracy for those subjects hearing
          Silbo for the first time is quite impressive, suggests Dr. Cuskley.
          Intelligibility to the uninitiated is a key difference between Silbo
          Gomero and the many other non-spoken forms of language that exist
          today. For example, when subjects were tested on their ability to
          understand American Sign Language (ASL), they only scored 25% for
          intelligibility. Even after some basic training in ASL, this only rose
          to 33.6%, comparable to a complete novice's understanding of Silbo.
          Yet with some guidance and practice, they can learn to recognize words
          even on a first encounter.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There are more than 70 other whistled languages still in use in remote
          and mountainous areas throughout the world, including Turkey, Mexico,
          Greece and China. None of these have the size or status of Silbo
          Gomero, and none have achieved the recognition it now enjoys. But in
          most of the places where these languages survive, their long-term
          future is uncertain. In Kuskoy, Turkey, the next most famous whistled
          language community, many young people are not learning to whistle.
          There is now a similar risk for Silbo Gomero. Although children are
          learning it at school, they then have few opportunities to practice it
          or use it in context, and as a result, not many of them continue to do
          so. This, coupled with its declining everyday use for communication,
          inevitably means that the skill level is gradually deteriorating.
          Nevertheless, the rapid progress in revival and protection provides
          some hope for the long-term future of whistling languages.

          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>,
          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">The importance of children's play</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Brick by brick, six-year-old Alice is building a magical kingdom.
          Imagining fairy-tale turrets and fire-breathing dragons, wicked
          witches and gallant heroes, she's creating an enchanting world.
          Although she isn't aware of it, this fantasy is helping her take her
          first steps towards her capacity for creativity and so it will have
          important repercussions in her adult life.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Minutes later, Alice has abandoned the kingdom in favour of playing
          schools with her younger brother. When she bosses him around as his
          'teacher', she's practicing how to regulate her emotions through
          pretence. Later on, when they tire of this and settle down with a
          board game, she's learning about the need to follow rules and take
          turns with a partner.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'Play in all its rich variety is one of the highest achievements of
          the human species,' says Dr. David Whitebread from the Faculty of
          Education at the University of Cambridge, UK. 'It underpins how we
          develop as intellectual, problem-solving adults and is crucial to our
          success as a highly adaptable species.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Recognising the importance of play is not new: over two millennia ago,
          the Greek philosopher Plato extolled its virtues as a means of
          developing skills for adult life, and ideas about play-based learning
          have been developing since the 19th century.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But we live in changing times, and Whitebread is mindful of a
          worldwide decline in play, pointing out that over half the people in
          the world now live in cities. 'The opportunities for free play, which
          I experienced almost every day of my childhood, are becoming
          increasingly scarce,' he says. Outdoor play is curtailed by
          perceptions of risk to do with traffic, as well as parents' increased
          wish to protect their children from being the victims of crime, and by
          the emphasis on 'earlier is better' which is leading to greater
          competition in academic learning and schools being judged by test
          results. International bodies like the United Nations and the European
          Union have begun to develop policies concerned with children's right
          to play, and to consider implications for leisure facilities and
          educational programmes.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But what they don't always understand is the potential of play in
          schools. 'For many children, playing and learning are not separate
          activities at all,' says Whitebread. In a study carried out by his
          colleague, researcher Marisol Basilio, over 800 primary-school
          teachers were asked what they thought children learned through play:
          many mentioned social skills, but 'strikingly, many did not appreciate
          the contribution that play makes to children's cognitive development
          in particular'.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Whitebread's research team at the PEDAL Centre, which he directs, have
          been providing evidence to fill in the gaps in our understanding of
          the importance of play in the development of qualities such as
          independence and creativity. 'A strong possibility is that play
          supports the early development of children's self control,' explains
          Dr. Emily Farran, also of the Faculty of Education. 'This is our
          ability to develop awareness of our own thinking processes – it
          influences how effectively we go about undertaking challenging
          activities.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In a study carried out by Whitebread's colleague, researcher Marisol
          Basilio, children were given puzzles to complete under two conditions:
          they could ask for help, or they had to play with a puzzle first. The
          results revealed that children who were encouraged to play with the
          puzzle first did better on the puzzles, performed better on subsequent
          assessments taken on their own, and were less reliant on asking for
          help from adults. In other words, children developed better cognitive
          skills when they had played.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Children are more likely to be aware of their own thought processes,
          and become more effective, independent learners, if teachers engage
          with their children in playful ways, rather than direct teaching. The
          traditional role is to teach, but researchers at the PEDAL Centre
          disagree. 'It may be that we need to consider other roles: partner,
          guide, mentor,' says Whitebread. 'Understanding that play is a way
          children learn – without being "taught" – is a research challenge for
          the 21st century.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Beyond the immediate question of how best to help children learn,
          there's the related question of how the quality of childhood affects
          physical and mental health later on. Professor Alison Gopnik, author
          of The Gardener and the Carpenter, told the audience at the PEDAL
          Centre's launch that children's play is evolution's answer to the
          uncertainty of the future, an adaptive strategy enabling flexible
          responses to the environment, not based on genes alone.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The PEDAL Centre is also advancing research work on the role of play
          in preparing for uncertainty and coping with stress. Extending the
          ways children learn through play to include the classroom brings a new
          set of challenges. Parents and policy makers tend to favour
          traditional approaches, especially when national and international
          benchmarking systems for measuring achievements in literacy, maths and
          science are so visible.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The research being done at the PEDAL Centre takes on the challenge of
          playing the long game: proving the importance of play in strengthening
          mental and physical health, in developing resilience in a constantly
          evolving world, and in transforming the quality of childhood.
          Whitebread's team hope that their work will improve the intellectual
          architecture of the minds of future generations, and that the study of
          play will earn its own place on the timetable of life.
