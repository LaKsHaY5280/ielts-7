        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Bringing cinnamon to Europe</h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Cinnamon is a sweet, fragrant spice produced from the inner bark of
          trees of the genus Cinnamomum, which is native to the Indian
          sub-continent. It was known in biblical times, and is mentioned in
          several books of the Bible, both as an ingredient that was mixed with
          oils for anointing people's bodies, and also as a token indicating
          friendship among lovers and friends. In ancient Rome, mourners
          attending funerals burnt cinnamon to create a pleasant scent. Most
          often, however, the spice found its primary use as an additive to food
          and drink. In the Middle Ages, Europeans who could afford the spice
          used it to flavor food, particularly meat, and to impress those around
          them with their ability to purchase an expensive condiment from the
          'exotic' East. At a banquet, a host would offer guests a plate with
          various spices piled upon it as a sign of the wealth at his or her
          disposal. Cinnamon was also reported to have health benefits, and was
          thought to cure various ailments, such as indigestion.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the European middle classes began
          to desire the lifestyle of the elite, including their consumption of
          spices. This led to a growth in demand for cinnamon and other spices.
          At that time, cinnamon was transported by Arab merchants, who closely
          guarded the secret of the source of the spice from potential rivals.
          They took it from India, where it was grown, on camels via an overland
          route to the Mediterranean. Their journey ended when they reached
          Alexandria. European traders sailed there to purchase their supply of
          cinnamon, then brought it back to Venice. The spice then travelled
          from that great trading city to markets all around Europe. Because the
          overland trade route allowed for only small quantities of the spice to
          reach Europe, and because Venice had a virtual monopoly of the trade,
          the Venetians could set the price of cinnamon exorbitantly high. These
          prices, coupled with the increasing demand, spurred the search for new
          routes to Asia by Europeans eager to take part in the spice trade.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Seeking the high profits promised by the cinnamon market, Portuguese
          traders arrived on the island of Ceylon in the Indian Ocean toward the
          end of the 15th century. Before Europeans arrived on the island, the
          state had organized the cultivation of cinnamon. People belonging to
          the ethnic group called the Salagama would peel the bark off young
          shoots of the cinnamon plant in the rainy season, when the wet bark
          was more pliable. During the peeling process, they curled the bark
          into the 'stick' shape still associated with the spice today. The
          Salagama then gave the finished product to the king as a form of
          tribute. When the Portuguese arrived, they needed to increase
          production significantly, and so enslaved many other members of the
          Ceylonese native population, forcing them to work in cinnamon
          harvesting. In 1518, the Portuguese built a fort on Ceylon, which
          enabled them to protect the island, so helping them to develop a
          monopoly in the cinnamon trade and generate very high profits. In the
          late 16th century, for example, they enjoyed a tenfold profit when
          shipping cinnamon over a journey of eight days from Ceylon to India.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          When the Dutch arrived off the coast of southern Asia at the very
          beginning of the 17th century, the set their sights on displacing the
          Portuguese as kings of cinnamon. The Dutch allied themselves with
          Kandy, an inland kingdom on Ceylon. In return for payments of
          elephants and cinnamon, they protected the native king from the
          Portuguese. By 1649, the Dutch broke the 150-year Portuguese monopoly
          when they overran and occupied their factories. By 1658, they had
          permanently expelled the Portuguese from the island, thereby gaining
          control of the lucrative cinnamon trade.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In order to protect their hold on the market, the Dutch, like the
          Portuguese before them, treated the native inhabitants harshly.
          Because of the need to boost production and satisfy Europe's
          ever-increasing appetite for cinnamon, the Dutch began to alter the
          harvesting practices of the Ceylonese. Over time, the supply of
          cinnamon trees on the island became nearly exhausted, due to
          systematic stripping of the bark. Eventually, the Dutch began
          cultivating their own cinnamon trees to supplement the diminishing
          number of wild trees available for use.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Then, in 1996, the English arrived on Ceylon, thereby displacing the
          Dutch from their control of the cinnamon monopoly. By the middle of
          the 19th century, production of cinnamon reached 1,000 tons a year,
          after a lower grade quality of the spice became acceptable to European
          tastes. By that time, cinnamon was being grown in other parts of the
          Indian Ocean region and in the West Indies, Brazil, and Guyana. Not
          only was a monopoly of cinnamon becoming impossible, but the spice
          trade overall was diminishing in economic potential, and was
          eventually superseded by the rise of trade in coffee, tea, chocolate,
          and sugar.

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Oxytocin</h3>

        <p className="italic mb-4">
          The positive and negative effects of the chemical known as the 'love
          hormone'
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Oxytocin is a chemical, a hormone produced in the pituitary gland in
          the brain. It was through various studies focusing on animals that
          scientists first became aware of the influence of oxytocin. They
          discovered that it helps reinforce the bonds between prairie voles,
          which mate for life, and triggers the motherly behaviour that sheep
          show towards their newborn lambs. It is also released by women in
          childbirth, strengthening the attachment between mother and baby. Few
          chemicals have as positive a reputation as oxytocin, which is
          sometimes referred to as the 'love hormone'. One sniff of it can, it
          is claimed, make a person more trusting, empathetic, generous and
          cooperative. It is time, however, to revise this wholly optimistic
          view. A new wave of studies has shown that its effects vary greatly
          depending on the person and the circumstances, and it can impact on
          our social interactions for worse as well as for better.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Oxytocin's role in human behaviour first emerged in 2005. In a
          groundbreaking experiments, Markus Heinrichs and his colleagues at the
          University of Freiburg, Germany, asked volunteers to do an activity in
          which they could invest money with an anonymous person who was not
          guaranteed to be honest. The team found the participants who had
          sniffed oxytocin via a nasal spray beforehand invested more money than
          those who received a placebo instead. The study was the start of
          research into the effects of oxytocin on human interactions. 'For
          eight years, it was quite a lonesome field,' Heinrichs recalls. 'Now,
          everyone is interested.' These follow-up studies have shown that after
          a sniff of the hormone, people become more charitable, better at
          reading emotions on others' faces and at communicating constructively
          in arguments. Together, the results fuelled the view that oxytocin
          universally enhanced the positive aspects of our social nature.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Then, after a few years, contrasting findings began to emerge. Simone
          Shamay-Tsoory at the at the University of Haifa, Israel, found that
          when volunteers played a competitive game, those who inhaled the
          hormone showed more pleasure when they beat other players, and felt
          more envy when others won. What's more, administering oxytocin also
          has sharply contrasting outcomes depending on a person's disposition.
          Jennifer Bartz from Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, found
          that it improves people's ability to read emotions, but only if they
          are not very socially adept to begin with. Her research also shows
          that oxytocin in fact reduces cooperation in subjects who are
          particularly anxious or sensitive to rejection.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Another discovery is that oxytocin's effects vary depending on who we
          are interacting with. Studies conducted by Carolyn DeClerck of the
          University of Antwerp, Belgium, revealed that people who had received
          a dose of oxytocin actually became less cooperative when dealing with
          complete strangers. Meanwhile, Carsten De Dreu at the University of
          Amsterdam in the Netherlands discovered that volunteers given oxytocin
          showed favouritism: Dutch men became quicker to associate positive
          words with Dutch names than with foreign ones, for example. According
          to De Dreu, oxytocin drives people to care for those in their social
          circles and defend them from outside dangers. So, it appears that
          oxytocin strengthens biases, rather than promoting general goodwill,
          as was previously thought.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          There were signs of these subtleties from the start. Bartz has
          recently shown that in almost half of the existing research results,
          oxytocin influenced only certain individuals or in certain
          circumstances. Where once researchers took no notice of such findings,
          now a more nuanced understanding of oxytocin's effects is propelling
          investigations down new lines. To Bartz, the key to understanding what
          the hormone does lies in pinpointing its core function rather than in
          cataloguing its seemingly endless effects. There are several
          hypotheses which are not mutually exclusive. Oxytocin could help to
          reduce anxiety and fear. Or it could simply motivate people to seek
          out social connections. She believes that oxytocin acts as a chemical
          spotlight that shines on social clues – a shift in posture, a flicker
          of the eyes, a dip in the voice – making people more attuned to their
          social environment. This would explain why it makes us more likely to
          look others in the eye and improves our ability to identify emotions.
          But it could also make things worse for people who are overly
          sensitive or prone to interpreting social cues in the worst light.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Perhaps we should not be surprised that the oxytocin story has become
          more perplexing. The hormone is found in everything from octopuses to
          sheep, and its evolutionary roots stretch back half a billion years.
          'It's a very simple and ancient molecule that has been co-opted for
          many different functions,' says Sue Carter at the University of
          Illinois, Chicago, USA. 'It affects primitive parts of the brain like
          the amygdala, so it's going to have many effects on just about
          everything.' Bartz agrees. 'Oxytocin probably does some very basic
          things, but once you add our higher-order thinking and social
          situations, these basic processes could manifest in different ways
          depending on individual differences and context.'

          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">MAKING THE MOST OF TRENDS</h3>

        <p className="italic mb-4">
          Experts from Harvard Business School give advice to managers
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Most managers can identify the major trends of the day. But it the
          course of conducting research in a number of industries and working
          directly with companies, we have discovered that managers often fail
          to recognize the less obvious but profound ways these trends are
          influencing consumers' aspirations, attitudes, and behaviors. This is
          especially true of trends that managers view as peripheral to their
          core markets.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Many ignore trends in their innovation strategies or adopt a
          wait-and-see approach and let competitors take the lead. At a minimum,
          such responses mean missed profit opportunities. At the extreme, they
          can jeopardize a company by ceding to rivals the opportunity to
          transform the industry. The purpose of this article is twofold: to
          spur managers to think more expansively about how trends could
          engender new value propositions in their core markets, and to provide
          some high-level advice on how to make market research and product
          development personnel more adept at analyzing and exploiting trends.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          One strategy, known as 'infuse and augment', is to design a product or
          service that retains most of the attributes and functions of existing
          products in the category but adds others that address the needs and
          desires unleashed by a major trend. A case in point in the Poppy range
          of handbags, which the firm Coach created in response to the economic
          downturn of 2008. The Coach brand had been a symbol of opulence and
          luxury for nearly 70 years, and the most obvious reaction to the
          downturn would have been to lower prices. However, that would have
          risked cheapening the brand's image. Instead, they initiated a
          consumer-research project which revealed that customers were eager to
          lift themselves and the country out of tough times. Using these
          insights, Coach launched the lower-priced Poppy handbags, which were
          in vibrant colors, and looked more youthful and playful than
          conventional Coach products. Creating the sub-brand allowed Coach to
          avert an across-the-board price cut. In contrast to the many companies
          that responded to the recession by cutting prices, Coach saw the new
          consumer mindset as an opportunity for innovation and renewal.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          A further example of this strategy was supermarket Tesco's response to
          consumers' growing concerns about the environment. With that in mind,
          Tesco, one of the world's top five retailers, introduced its Greener
          Living program, which demonstrates the company's commitment to
          protecting the environment by involving consumers in ways that produce
          tangible results. For example, Tesco customers can accumulate points
          for such activities as reusing bags, recycling cans and printer
          cartridges, and buying home-insulation materials. Like points earned
          on regular purchases, these green points can be redeemed for cash.
          Tesco has not abandoned its traditional retail offering but augmented
          its business with these innovations, thereby infusing its value
          proposition with a green streak.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          A more radical strategy is 'combine and transcend'. This entails
          combining aspects of the product's existing value proposition with
          attributes addressing changes arising from a trend, to create a novel
          experience – one that may land the company in an entirely new market
          space. At first glance, spending resources to incorporate elements of
          a seemingly irrelevant trend into one's core offerings sounds like
          it's hardly worthwhile. But consider Nike's move to integrate the
          digital revolution into its reputation for high-performance athletic
          footwear. In 2006, they teamed up with technology company Apple to
          launch Nike+, a digital sports kit comprising a sensor that attaches
          to the running shoe and a wireless receiver that connects to the
          user's iPod. By combining Nike's original value proposition for
          amateur athletes with one for digital consumers, the Nike+ sports kit
          and web interface moved the company from a focus on athletic apparel
          to a new plane of engagement with its customers.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          A third approach, known as 'counteract and reaffirm', involves
          developing products or services that stress the values traditionally
          associated with the category in ways that allow consumers to oppose –
          or at least temporarily escape from – the aspects of trends they view
          as undesirable. A product that accomplished this is the ME2, a video
          game created by Canada's iToys. By reaffirming the toy category's
          association with physical play, the ME2 counteracted some of the
          widely perceived negative impacts of digital gaming devices. Like
          other handheld games, the device featured a host of exciting
          interactive games, a full-color LCD screen, and advanced 3D graphics.
          What set it apart was that it incorporated the traditional physical
          component of children's play: it contained a pedometer, which tracked
          and awarded points for physical activity (walking, running, biking,
          skateboarding, climbing stairs). The child could use the points to
          enhance various virtual skills needed for the video game. The ME2,
          introduced in mid-2008, catered to kids' huge desire to play video
          games while countering the negatives, such as associations with lack
          of exercise and obesity.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Once you have gained perspective on how trend-related changes in
          consumer opinions and behaviors impact on your category, you can
          determine which of our three innovation strategies to pursue. When
          your category's basic value proposition continues to be meaningful for
          consumers influenced by the trend, the infuse-and-augment strategy
          will allow you to reinvigorate the category. If analysis reveals an
          increasing disparity between your category and consumers' new focus,
          your innovations need to transcend the category to integrate the two
          worlds. Finally, if aspects of the category clash with undesired
          outcomes of a trend, such as associations with unhealthy lifestyles,
          there is an opportunity to counteract those changes by reaffirming the
          core values of your category.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Trends – technological, economic, environmental, social, or political
          – that affect how people perceive the world around them and shape what
          they expect from products and services present firms with unique
          opportunities for growth.
