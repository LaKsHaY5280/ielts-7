            A Purple Rainbow: The Truth
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Having actors playing popular rock band <em>Purple Rainbow</em>{" "}
            seemed like a bad idea, but in fact they're impressive musicians
            themselves. Their fans in the film were actual fans of the group and
            transferred their enthusiasm to the actors very convincingly. I
            assumed there would be plenty of music, linked by weak dialogue, but
            I was wrong. And the support that band members gave to lead singer
            Jerry Cosgrove when tragedy entered his life had me close to tears,
            giving me a new appreciation of the band.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">B Home Fires</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            I expected a standard, rather dull, story about domestic life, like
            the director's last two films. Instead, <em>Home Fires</em> had me
            on the edge of my seat with excitement. It's certainly worth a
            second viewing. Having said that, although it is apparently a film
            intended for all ages, many children would find the long discussions
            of relationship issues boring, and they contributed little or
            nothing to the film.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">C The Jeffersons</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            One of the most popular films of the past half century is{" "}
            <em>Mary and Tom</em>, and a remake of it seems unnecessary.
            Nevertheless, <em>The Jeffersons</em> has some delightful elements,
            particularly the acting of Yvonne Richards. She really brought the
            character she played to life, but sadly, neither she nor the other
            actors could make the script sound natural.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">D Space Challenge 5</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This film makes an important ethical point about treating other
            people with respect, but that is likely to be missed by many
            teenagers, the target audience, as it assumes familiarity with the
            world as it was 20 years ago. With change happening so fast these
            days, many of the references will leave them confused.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">E Uplands</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <em>Uplands</em> could have been a delightful film: it has a
            charming story, witty dialogue, and is visually breathtaking. But
            the two lead actors are at their best in thrillers, not films like
            this one. James Petherick, who plays the hero, fails to gain the
            sympathy of the audience, who should be moved by the ups and downs
            in his life.

            What to do if you are made redundant
          </h3>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Employees are made redundant when a company has to reduce the
            workforce because a job or jobs are no longer needed. It has nothing
            to do with the employees' ability to do their jobs. However, dealing
            with redundancy can be difficult. Here are some tips on how to cope.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            First of all, don't panic. It's common for people to either rush
            into a flurry of activity or be frozen by the shock of being
            suddenly made redundant. The best course of action is to keep calm
            and draw up a list of all of the things you need to arrange in the
            months ahead. It's important to find out what your rights are.
            Obtain a copy of the in-house redundancy policy if there is one and
            check out your contract for exit terms.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Try to maintain good relations wherever possible with your employer,
            even if you are angry about the manner of your exit. You will still
            need a reasonable reference when the time comes to move on, and it
            may be that your boss can make useful introductions or offer you
            consultancy work.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Help from a professional outplacement company can make a huge
            difference to your job search success and reduce the amount of time
            taken to find your next role. You can purchase this yourself, but
            there are advantages to having it arranged via your company.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Don't rush into applying for any or every job that comes up. Take
            stock of what you have to offer, what you want to do, and carry out
            in-depth research to find out what employers are actually looking
            for. Talk to people in your target industry for career advice and
            information. This information will be invaluable in helping you
            identify potential employers.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Assess whether there are any gaps in experience or qualifications
            that could be a barrier to getting another job and address them.
            Enrol on some of those courses you have always been too busy to go
            on: not only will this enhance your skills, it also shows your
            commitment to continuous professional development.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Redundancy enables you to move your career forward in line with your
            own personal agenda. Although it can be traumatic, many people find
            that redundancy is actually the incentive they need to take their
            career in the direction they actually want to go. So think about
            what you really want, and go for it.

          <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">Instructions to new kitchen staff</h4>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Dress standards at our restaurants are extremely important whichever
            area you work in. The following information will help ensure that
            you have a professional appearance every day as you carry out your
            foodservice duties.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Palvin's Restaurant chain provides new kitchen staff with their
            uniforms and you are advised to come to work with a note of your
            chest, waist and hip measurements to assist in this process. On your
            first day, you'll be issued with two pairs of trousers, two aprons,
            two jackets and two hats. Once you're happy that you have the
            correct size, please take the garments home and add a name tag to
            each one. Put these inside the garments so that they cannot be seen.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Kitchen work can be messy, and it is up to you to make sure that
            your uniform is kept clean, but you will receive a laundry allowance
            to help you do this. Towels are available at work, but it's a good
            idea to bring your own too in case you need it. You can keep this
            and any other personal items safe in the lockers that are available
            for use while you're on duty. It's advisable to bring your own small
            padlock for these.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Uniforms should not be worn outside work. You should wear your
            normal clothes to and from work but make sure they're respectable.
            For example, hoodies and other similar tops are not acceptable in
            the kitchens; if it's cold, wear a jacket. When you arrive at work,
            you can use the changing facilities located next to the lockers to
            put on your uniform. You can wear your own shoes in the kitchens as
            long as they're sturdy and enclosed. We strongly recommend rubber
            soles so that they do not slip on the floor.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            If you incur any injuries that require crutches while you're working
            for the company, you cannot then take on any tasks that involve
            standing up. However, if such a situation should occur, we will make
            every effort to place you in an appropriate area where you can sit
            down to work so you will not need to take time off. Employees who
            have smaller injuries, such as hand cuts, need to check with their
            manager whether they can come to work: you may have to take time off
            to avoid infection.

            The forgotten role of women in medieval arts
          </h3>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>A</strong> A team of archaeologists recently and
            unexpectedly revealed direct archaeological evidence of the
            involvement of medieval women in the production of manuscripts. This
            challenges the widespread assumptions that men were the sole
            producers of books throughout the period in European history known
            as the Middle Ages (600–1500 AD). They did so by identifying
            particles of blue pigment in the fossilised dental plaque of a
            medieval woman as lapis lazuli, an extremely valuable stone at the
            time. The findings are the first of their kind and strongly suggest
            it will be possible to increase the profile of ancient female
            artists in the historical and archaeological record by analysing
            their dirty teeth.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>B</strong> This discovery was made possible by applying
            technological advances in the field of archaeological science to a
            little-studied deposit on teeth known as tartar, which is
            mineralised dental plaque. In most societies today, oral hygiene
            practices are part of our daily routine, meaning that dental plaque
            is regularly removed and doesn't have a chance to build up on our
            teeth. This was not the case in the past. Plaque built up and
            mineralised over the course of people's lives. This solid deposit
            has unique archaeological potential. A key characteristic of dental
            plaque is that while it forms it has the ability to entrap a wide
            range of microscopic and molecular debris that enters a person's
            mouth. When dental plaque hardens and becomes tartar, it can entomb
            these particles and molecules for hundreds or thousands of years –
            potentially even millions.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>C</strong> The majority of scholarly work conducted on
            ancient tartar has been centred on what people ate but, besides
            taking in food, the human mouth is subject to a constant influx of
            particles of different types directly from the environment. Tree and
            grass pollen, spores, cotton fibres, medicinal plants and
            micro-charcoal have all been reported among the finds from this type
            of dental analysis. Despite such promising evidence, the value of
            tartar as environmental evidence has not, so far, been much
            exploited.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>D</strong> The team analysed the skeletal remains of a
            female individual, known as B78, who lived in the 11th–12th century.
            She was buried in the grounds of a former women's monastery in
            Dalheim, Germany, that is in ruins today but was occupied by various
            religious groups for around a thousand years. They found well over
            100 bright blue particles, in the form of small crystals and
            individual flecks, scattered throughout the tartar which was still
            preserved on her teeth. Her skeletal remains had not indicated
            anything particular about her life, besides a general indication
            that she probably did not do any hard labour. The blue particles
            were unlike any other discovery – firstly because of their colour,
            and secondly because of their sheer number.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>E</strong> To be sure about the nature of the particles of
            bright blue powder trapped in the woman's tartar, a range of
            microscopy techniques were used. All techniques provided the same
            results: the blue specks were lazurite, the blue portion of the
            lapis lazuli stone, a substance more precious than gold in Medieval
            Europe. Afghanistan was the only source of the stone at the time,
            and the preparation of the pigment took great skill.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>F</strong> So how did particles of this precious material
            end up deposited on this woman's teeth? A variety of reasons were
            possible, from painting to accidental ingestion during pigment
            preparation, or even the consumption of the powder as a medicine.
            But the way in which the blue particles were found in her tartar –
            single flecks in different areas – pointed to repeated exposure, not
            a single intake. And creating a vivid blue pigment from lapis lazuli
            required an Arabic method of oil flotation that did not appear in
            European artists' manuals until after the 15th century. This all
            suggests that it's more likely that this ultramarine pigment was
            brought into the region as a finished product for use by artists.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>G</strong> The most likely explanation, then, is that this
            was an artist who repeatedly used her lips to make a fine point on
            the end of her brush in order to paint intricate detail on
            manuscripts. This finding suggests that women were more involved in
            the production of books throughout the Middle Ages than tends to be
            thought. Before the 12th century fewer than one per cent of the
            books that still remain can be traced to the work of women.
            Additionally, artists are largely invisible in both the historic and
            archaeological records as they rarely signed their work before the
            15th century and, until now, there have been no known skeletal
            markers directly associated with producing art. The work strongly
            points to the possibility of using microscopic particles entombed in
            ancient tartar to track the artists of ancient times. It also
            suggests that it may be possible to track other 'dusty' crafts using
            this method and thereby reveal the invisible workforce behind many
            forms of art.
