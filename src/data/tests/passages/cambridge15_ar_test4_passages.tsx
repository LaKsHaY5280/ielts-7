        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">The return of the huarango</h3>

        <p className="italic mb-4">
          The arid valleys of southern Peru are welcoming the return of a native
          plant
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The south coast of Peru is a narrow, 2,000-kilometre-long strip of
          desert squeezed between the Andes and the Pacific Ocean. It is also
          one of the most fragile ecosystems on Earth. It hardly ever rains
          there, and the only year-round source of water is located tens of
          metres below the surface. This is why the huarango tree is so suited
          to life there: it has the longest roots of any tree in the world. They
          stretch down 50-80 metres and, as well as sucking up water for the
          tree, they bring it into the higher subsoil, creating a water source
          for other plant life.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Dr David Beresford-Jones, archaeobotanist at Cambridge University, has
          been studying the role of the huarango tree in landscape change in the
          Lower Ica Valley in southern Peru. He believes the huarango was key to
          the ancient people's diet and, because it could reach deep water
          sources, it allowed local people to withstand years of drought when
          their other crops failed. But over the centuries huarango trees were
          gradually replaced with crops. Cutting down native woodland leads to
          erosion, as there is nothing to keep the soil in place. So when the
          huarangos go, the land turns into a desert. Nothing grows at all in
          the Lower Ica Valley now.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          For centuries the huarango tree was vital to the people of the
          neighbouring Middle Ica Valley too. They grew vegetables under it and
          ate products made from its seed pods. Its leaves and bark were used
          for herbal remedies, while its branches were used for charcoal for
          cooking and heating, and its trunk was used to build houses. But now
          it is disappearing rapidly. The majority of the huarango forests in
          the valley have already been cleared for fuel and agriculture –
          initially, these were smallholdings, but now they're huge farms
          producing crops for the international market.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'Of the forests that were here 1,000 years ago, 99 per cent have
          already gone,' says botanist Oliver Whaley from Kew Gardens in London,
          who, together with ethnobotanist Dr William Milliken, is running a
          pioneering project to protect and restore the rapidly disappearing
          habitat. In order to succeed, Whaley needs to get the local people on
          board, and that has meant overcoming local prejudices. 'Increasingly
          aspirational communities think that if you plant food trees in your
          home or street, it shows you are poor, and still need to grow your own
          food,' he says. In order to stop the Middle Ica Valley going the same
          way as the Lower Ica Valley, Whaley is encouraging locals to love the
          huarangos again. 'It's a process of cultural resuscitation,' he says.
          He has already set up a huarango festival to reinstate a sense of
          pride in their eco-heritage, and has helped local schoolchildren plant
          thousands of trees.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'In order to get people interested in habitat restoration, you need to
          plant a tree that is useful to them,' says Whaley. So, he has been
          working with local families to attempt to create a sustainable income
          from the huarangos by turning their products into foodstuffs. 'Boil up
          the beans and you get this thick brown syrup like molasses. You can
          also use it in drinks, soups or stews.' The pods can be ground into
          flour to make cakes, and the seeds roasted into a sweet, chocolatey
          'coffee'. 'It's packed full of vitamins and minerals,' Whaley says.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          And some farmers are already planting huarangos. Alberto Benevides,
          owner of Ica Valley's only certified organic farm, which Whaley helped
          set up, has been planting the tree for 13 years. He produces syrup and
          flour, and sells these products at an organic farmers' market in Lima.
          His farm is relatively small and doesn't yet provide him with enough
          to live on, but he hopes this will change. 'The organic market is
          growing rapidly in Peru,' Benevides says. 'I am investing in the
          future.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But even if Whaley can convince the local people to fall in love with
          the huarango again, there is still the threat of the larger farms.
          Some of these cut across the forests and break up the corridors that
          allow the essential movement of mammals, birds and pollen up and down
          the narrow forest strip. In the hope of counteracting this, he's
          persuading farmers to let him plant forest corridors on their land. He
          believes the extra woodland will also benefit the farms by reducing
          their water usage through a lowering of evaporation and providing a
          refuge for bio-control insects.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'If we can record biodiversity and see how it all works, then we're in
          a good position to move on from there. Desert habitats can reduce down
          to very little,' Whaley explains. 'It's not like a rainforest that
          needs to have this huge expanse. Life has always been confined to
          corridors and islands here. If you just have a few trees left, the
          population can grow up quickly because it's used to exploiting water
          when it arrives.' He sees his project as a model that has the
          potential to be rolled out across other arid areas around the world.
          'If we can do it here, in the most fragile system on Earth, then
          that's a real message of hope for lots of places, including Africa,
          where there is drought and they just can't afford to wait for rain.'

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 14-26</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">
          Silbo Gomero – the whistle 'language' of the Canary Islands
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          La Gomera is one of the Canary Islands situated in the Atlantic Ocean
          off the northwest coast of Africa. This small volcanic island is
          mountainous, with steep rocky slopes and deep, wooded ravines, rising
          to 1,487 metres at its highest peak. It is also home to the best known
          of the world's whistle 'languages', a means of transmitting
          information over long distances which is perfectly adapted to the
          extreme terrain of the island.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          This 'language', known as 'Silbo' or 'Silbo Gomero' – from the Spanish
          word for 'whistle' – is now shedding light on the language-processing
          abilities of the human brain, according to scientists. Researchers say
          that Silbo activates parts of the brain normally associated with
          spoken language, suggesting that the brain is remarkably flexible in
          its ability to interpret sounds as language.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'Science has developed the idea of brain areas that are dedicated to
          language, and we are starting to understand the scope of signals that
          can be recognised as language,' says David Corina, co-author of a
          recent study and associate professor of psychology at the University
          of Washington in Seattle.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Silbo is a substitute for Spanish, with individual words recoded into
          whistles which have high- and low-frequency tones. A whistler – or{" "}
          <em>silbador</em> – puts a finger in his or her mouth to increase the
          whistle's pitch, while the other hand can be cupped to adjust the
          direction of the sound. 'There is much more ambiguity in the whistled
          signal than in the spoken signal,' explains lead researcher Manuel
          Carreiras, psychology professor at the University of La Laguna on the
          Canary island of Tenerife. Because whistled 'words' can be hard to
          distinguish, silbadores rely on repetition, as well as awareness of
          context, to make themselves understood.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The silbadores of Gomera are traditionally shepherds and other
          isolated mountain folk, and their novel means of staying in touch
          allows them to communicate over distances of up to 10 kilometres.
          Carreiras explains that silbadores are able to pass a surprising
          amount of information via their whistles. 'In daily life they use
          whistles to communicate short commands, but any Spanish sentence could
          be whistled.' Silbo has proved particularly useful when fires have
          occurred on the island and rapid communication across large areas has
          been vital.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The study team used neuroimaging equipment to contrast the brain
          activity of silbadores while listening to whistled and spoken Spanish.
          Results showed the left temporal lobe of the brain, which is usually
          associated with spoken language, was engaged during the processing of
          Silbo. The researchers found that other key regions in the brain's
          frontal lobe also responded to the whistles, including those activated
          in response to sign language among deaf people. When the experiments
          were repeated with non-whistlers, however, activation was observed in
          all areas of the brain.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'Our results provide more evidence about the flexibility of human
          capacity for language in a variety of forms,' Corina says. 'These data
          suggest that left-hemisphere language regions are uniquely adapted for
          communicative purposes, independent of the modality of signal. The
          non-Silbo speakers were not recognising Silbo as a language. They had
          nothing to grab onto, so multiple areas of their brains were
          activated.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Carreiras says the origins of Silbo Gomero remain obscure, but that
          indigenous Canary Islanders, who were of North African origin, already
          had a whistled language when Spain conquered the volcanic islands in
          the 15th century. Whistled languages survive today in Papua New
          Guinea, Mexico, Vietnam, Guyana, China, Nepal, Senegal, and a few
          mountainous pockets in southern Europe. There are thought to be as
          many as 70 whistled languages still in use, though only 12 have been
          described and studied scientifically. This form of communication is an
          adaptation found among cultures where people are often isolated from
          each other, according to Julien Meyer, a researcher at the Institute
          of Human Sciences in Lyon, France. 'They are mostly used in mountains
          or dense forests,' he says. 'Whistled languages are quite clearly
          defined and represent an original adaptation of the spoken language
          for the needs of isolated human groups.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But with modern communication technology now widely available,
          researchers say whistled languages like Silbo are threatened with
          extinction. With dwindling numbers of Gomera islanders still fluent in
          the language, Canaries' authorities are taking steps to try to ensure
          its survival. Since 1999, Silbo Gomero has been taught in all of the
          island's elementary schools. In addition, locals are seeking
          assistance from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
          Cultural Organization (UNESCO). 'The local authorities are trying to
          get an award from the organisation to declare [Silbo Gomero] as
          something that should be preserved for humanity,' Carreiras adds.

          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">
          Environmental practices of big businesses
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The environmental practices of big businesses are shaped by a
          fundamental fact that for many of us offend our sense of justice.
          Depending on the circumstances, a business may maximize the amount of
          money it makes, at least in the short term, by damaging the
          environment and hurting people. That is still the case today for
          fishermen in an unmanaged fishery without quotas, and for
          international logging companies with short-term leases on tropical
          rainforest land in places with corrupt officials and unsophisticated
          landowners. When government regulation is effective, and when the
          public is environmentally aware, environmentally clean big businesses
          may out-compete dirty ones, but the reverse is likely to be true if
          government regulation is ineffective and if the public doesn't care.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          It is easy for the rest of us to blame a business for helping itself
          by hurting other people. But blaming alone is unlikely to produce
          change. It ignores the fact that businesses are not charities but
          profit-making companies, and that publicly owned companies with
          shareholders are under obligation to those shareholders to maximize
          profits, provided that they do so by legal means. US laws make a
          company's directors legally liable for something termed 'breach of
          fiduciary responsibility' if they knowingly manage a company in a way
          that reduces profits. The car manufacturer Henry Ford was in fact
          successfully sued by shareholders in 1919 for raising the minimum wage
          of his workers to $5 per day: the courts declared that, while Ford's
          humanitarian sentiments about his employees were nice, his business
          existed to make profits for its stockholders.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Our blaming of businesses also ignores the ultimate responsibility of
          the public for creating the condition that let a business profit
          through destructive environmental policies. In the long run, it is the
          public, either directly or through its politicians, that has the power
          to make such destructive policies unprofitable and illegal, and to
          make sustainable environmental policies profitable.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The public can do that by suing businesses for harming them, as
          happened after the Exxon Valdez disaster, in which over 40,000m
          <sup>3</sup> of oil were spilled off the coast of Alaska. The public
          may also make their opinion felt by preferring to buy sustainably
          harvested products; by making employees of companies with poor track
          records feel ashamed of their company and complain to their own
          management; by preferring their governments to award valuable
          contracts to businesses with a good environmental track record; and by
          pressing their governments to pass and enforce laws and regulations
          requiring good environmental practices.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In turn, big businesses can expert powerful pressure on any suppliers
          that might ignore public or government pressure. For instance, after
          the US public became concerned about the spread of a disease known as
          BSE, which was transmitted to humans through infected meat, the US
          government's Food and Drug Administration introduced rules demanding
          that the meat industry abandon practices associated with the risk of
          the disease spreading. But for five years the meat packers refused to
          follow these, claiming that they would be too expensive to obey.
          However, when a major fast-food company then made the same demands
          after customer purchases of its hamburgers plummeted, the meat
          industry complied within weeks. The public's task is therefore to
          identify which links in the supply chain are sensitive to public
          pressure: for instance, fast-food chains or jewelry stores, but not
          meat packers or gold miners.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Some readers may be disappointed or outraged that I place the ultimate
          responsibility for business practices harming the public on the public
          itself. I also believe that the public must accept the necessity for
          higher prices for products to cover the added costs, if any, of sound
          environmental practices. My views may seem to ignore the belief that
          businesses should act in accordance with moral principles even if this
          leads to a reduction in their profits. But I think we have to
          recognize that, throughout human history, in all politically complex
          human societies, government regulation has arisen precisely because it
          was found that not only did moral principles need to be made explicit,
          they also needed to be enforced.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          To me, the conclusion that the public has the ultimate responsibility
          for the behavior of even the biggest businesses is empowering and
          hopeful, rather than disappointing. My conclusion is not a moralistic
          one about who is right or wrong, admirable or selfish, a good guy or a
          bad guy. In the past, businesses have changed when the public came to
          expect and require different behavior, to reward businesses for
          behavior that the public wanted, and to make things difficult for
          businesses practicing behaviors that the public didn't want. I predict
          that in the future, just as in the past, changes in public attitudes
          will be essential for changes in businesses' environmental practices.
