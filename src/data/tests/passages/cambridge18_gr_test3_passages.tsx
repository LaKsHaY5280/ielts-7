        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Manly Beaches</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Next time you visit Manly, 30 minutes by ferry from the centre of
          Australia's biggest city, Sydney, try some of these less famous
          beaches
        </p>

        <div className="mb-4">
          <h4 className="font-bold">A Fairy Bower</h4>
          <p>
            Located-in a marine protection area, the water is perfect for
            paddling, snorkelling or even scuba diving. There is a small gift
            shop for unusual souvenirs, and a kiosk that rents stand-up
            paddleboards. Buses do not stop nearby so a walk is necessary.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-4">
          <h4 className="font-bold">B North Steyne</h4>
          <p>
            This popular beach is a little further from the ferry than the main
            beach and it always feels less crowded. North Steyne has
            professional lifeguards on duty, but the surf can be hazardous so
            check conditions if swimming with young ones. If you want to try
            surfing for the first time, Manly Surf School operates out of the
            surf club located on the beach. Please note that boards are reserved
            for students and are not available for rent.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-4">
          <h4 className="font-bold">C Delwood</h4>
          <p>
            Delwood's secluded cove is a scenic walk from the ferry along the
            harbour walkway. There are no shops, so bring a picnic and have a
            peaceful swim off the rocks. You'll probably have the beach to
            yourself.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-4">
          <h4 className="font-bold">D Little Manly</h4>
          <p>
            This popular harbour beach has a net that encloses the swimming
            area. It is a good option for families as the protected area makes
            It easy to keep an eye on kids playing in the water. There is also a
            large playground, a public barbecue that anyone can use and toilet
            facilities, which make this a great spot for a family day out.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-4">
          <h4 className="font-bold">E East Esplanade</h4>
          <p>
            Located next to Manly Wharf, East Esplanade is a popular spot all
            day. There is no beach closer to the ferry or buses than this one.
            Kayakers meet for a paddle here as the sun rises, and daytrippers
            sit on the sand during the day. People get together on the grass
            after work, and bring drinks, snacks and music to watch the sun go
            down.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-6">
          <h4 className="font-bold">F Shelly Beach</h4>
          <p>
            This is the best spot if you don't like big waves. Rent a beach
            chair or head straight to the Boathouse Cafe, the perfect place for
            breakfast or lunch. Please note that Shelly Beach gets overly
            crowded at times, so avoid it on a sunny weekend afternoon.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Company car parking policy</h3>
        <div className="mb-6">
          <p className="mb-2">
            DG Contracts recognises that many people working in the organisation
            require a vehicle for business purposes and aims to provide parking
            facilities for as many individuals as possible. However, car parking
            provision is limited. DG Contracts therefore actively encourages
            staff to reduce their carbon footprint by using public transport,
            walking or cycling, or by organising ways of sharing the use of
            cars.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            The car parking policy aims to allocate parking on a fair and
            equitable basis with spaces being given first to those employees who
            claim above a certain mileage of travel for business purposes.
            individuals who are allocated a parking space will be issued with a
            parking permit and a number which corresponds to a car parking
            space. If there are any non-allocated car parking spaces, these can
            be utilised by employees on a first-come. first-served basis. In
            some cases, designated parking areas are required for company
            vehicles, which must be parked securely at night. However, employees
            may park in these areas in the daytime.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            If any individual leaves the company prior to the expiry of their
            parking permit. this will be handed on to the member of staff who
            acts as their replacement. assuming that this person requires it. If
            any individual who has been issued a parking permit takes maternity
            leave or is signed off work for a lengthy period. their parking
            permit will be re- allocated to the staff member appointed as cover
            for this individual during their absence.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Employees who park their cars in a DG company car park do so at
            their own risk and must follow the rules laid down in the parking
            policy. If you have any complaints concerning any aspect of car
            parking at DG company car parks, please address them to the HR
            Manager.

          Ensuring safety in the office
        </h3>
        <div className="mb-6">
          <p className="mb-2">
            It's fairly obvious that safety and health hazards can exist on
            worksites filled with heavy machinery and equipment. However, a
            surprising number of hazards can also be present in the office.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            The most common types of injuries are slips, trips and falls. Boxes,
            files and other items piled in walkways can create a tripping
            hazard. Be certain that all materials are safely stored in their
            proper location to prevent build-up of clutter. Further, in addition
            to posing an electrical hazard. stretching wires across walkways
            creates a tripping hazard, so ensure they are properly secured and
            covered.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Standing on rolling office chairs is a significant fall hazard.
            Workers who need to reach something at an elevated height should use
            a stepladder. which must be fully opened and placed on level ground.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Workers can collide when making turns in the hallways and around
            blind corners. This can be prevented by installing mirrors in these
            places so workers can see who is coming. Floors may also present a
            hazard. Marble or tile can become very slippery, particularly when
            wet. The use of carpets can help to reduce falls and can be
            especially helpful at main doors, where workers are likely to be
            coming in with wet shoes.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Another type of injury comes from workers being struck by an object.
            Filing cabinets may be in danger of tipping over if drawers are left
            open, and filing cabinets and desks may also create a tripping
            hazard if they are not properly closed. High piles of materials and
            equipment can cause major injuries if they are knocked over. Heavy
            objects should always be stored close to the ground. and the load
            capacity of shelves should never be exceeded.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Because office workers spend most of their day seated at a desk,
            they are prone to strains and other injuries related to posture and
            repetitive movement. Desks, seating, monitor stands, etc. should all
            be adjustable in order to accommodate the widest possible range of
            employees. Typing from hard copy can lead to neck strain if a worker
            is forced to look down repeatedly to the desk at the document being
            copied and back to the computer screen. This can be prevented by
            providing holders, which help to prevent muscle imbalance by
            positioning the document at the same level as the screen. Another
            cause of neck injuries is incorrect placement of the computer mouse
            — this should always be kept beside the keyboard, and at the same
            level.

            <h4 className="font-bold inline">A</h4>
            <p className="inline ml-2">
              The long straight roads built by the Romans have, in many cases,
              become just as famous in history as their greatest emperors and
              generals. Building upon more ancient routes and creating a huge
              number of new ones, Roman engineers were fearless in their plans
              to join one point to another in as straight a line as possible,
              whatever the difficulties in geography and the costs in manpower.
              Consequently, roads required bridges, tunnels, viaducts and many
              other architectural and engineering features to create a series of
              breathtaking but highly useful monuments, which spread from Europe
              to eastern parts of the Roman empire.

            <h4 className="font-bold inline">B</h4>
            <p className="inline ml-2">
              The Romans did not invent roads, but, as in so many other areas,
              they took an idea which went back as far as the Bronze Age and
              extended that concept, daring to squeeze from it the fullest
              possible potential. The first and most famous great Roman road was
              the Via Appia, or Appian Way. Constructed from 312 BCE, and
              covering 196 kilometres, it linked Rome to ancient Capua in Italy
              in as straight a line as possible and was appropriately known to
              the Romans as the Regina Viarum or 'Queen of Roads'. Much like a
              modern highway, it bypassed small towns along the way, and it
              largely ignored geographical obstacles. The road would later be
              extended to 569 kilometres in length.

            <p className="inline ml-2">
              The network of public Roman roads covered over 120,000 kilometres.
              Besides permitting the rapid deployment of troops and, more
              importantly, the wheeled vehicles which supplied them with food
              and equipment, Roman roads allowed for an increase in trade and
              cultural exchange. Roads were also one of the ways Rome could
              demonstrate its authority. For this reason, many roads began and
              ended in a triumphal arch, and the imperial prestige associated
              with a road project was demonstrated in the fact that roads were
              very often named after the officials who funded them; for example,
              the Via Appia takes its name from the Roman magistrate Appius
              Claudius Caecus.

              To achieve the objective of constructing the shortest routes
              possible between two points, all manner of engineering
              difficulties had to be overcome. Once extensive surveying had been
              carried out, to ensure the preposed route was actually straight
              and to determine what various engineering methods were needed,
              marshes had to be drained, forests cut through, creeks diverted,
              bedrock channelled, mountainsides cut into, rivers crossed with
              bridges, valleys traversed with viaducts and tunnels built through
              mountains. When all that was done, roads had to be levelled,
              reinforced with support walls or terracing and then, of course,
              maintained, which they were for over 800 years.

              Major roads were around a standard 4.2 metres wide, which was
              enough space for two vehicles to pass each other. First a trench
              was dug in the earth, and a layer of large stones was used to form
              the foundation. This was followed by a substantial deposit of
              smaller broken materials — often crushed brick was used for this
              purpose, and on top of this, a layer of fine gravel was added.
              This upper section of the road was referred to as the nucleus and
              was then surfaced with blocks or slabs. Mountain roads might also
              have ridges running across the surface of the slabs, to give
              animals better grip, and have ruts cut into the stone to guide
              wheeled vehicles.

            Roads were purposely inclined slightly from the centre down to the
            kerb to allow rainwater to run off along the sides. Many also had
            parallel ditches that collected the runoff and formed a drainage
            canal on each side of the road. A path of packed gravel for
            pedestrians typically ran along each side of the road, varying in
            width from 1 to 3 metres. Separating the path from the road were the
            kerb stones, which were regular upright slabs. Busier stretches of
            main W l roads had areas where vehicles could pull over, and some of
            these had services for travellers and their animals. Milestones were
            also set up at regular intervals along the road and these often
            recorded who was responsible for the upkeep of that stretch of the
            road and what repairs had been made.

              Lasting symbols of the imagination of Roman engineers are the many
              arched bridges and viaducts still standing today that helped
              achieve the engineers' straight-line goal. The Romans built to
              last, and the piers of bridges which crossed rivers, for example,
              were often built with a resistant prow-shape and used massive
              durable blocks of stone, while the upper parts might be built of
              of stone blocks strengthened with iron clamps. Perhaps the most
              impressive bridge was at Narni; 180 metres long, 8 metres wide and
              as high as 33 metres, it had 4 massive semicircular arches, one of
              which, stretching 32.1 metres, ranks as one of the longest
              block—arch spans in the ancient world. Recently hit by
              earthquakes, it is now having to undergo restoration work to
              repair the effects.

            Such was the engineering and surveying skill of the Romans that many
            of their roads have provided the basis for hundreds of today's
            routes across Europe and the Middle East. Many roads in Italy still
            use the original Roman name for certain stretches, and some bridges,
            such as at Tre Ponti in Venice, still carry road traffic today.
