              Civil disobedience is the active refusal to obey certain laws,
              demands or commands of a government. It involves peaceful protests
              against laws or government demands that are regarded as unjust.
              Practitioners of civil disobedience may be seeking to change the
              law that they are opposing, or they may simply be looking to
              obstruct the operation of the law or government policy.
              Alternatively, a person who employs civil disobedience may not
              actually object to the law they are breaking, but they consider it
              necessary to protest against what they regard as a greater
              injustice. Most activists who employ civil disobedience are
              choosing to disobey the law non-violently, rather than resorting
              to armed resistance or other forms of violent protest, which might
              include damage to property or harm to individuals. They are
              generally willing to accept the legal consequences of their
              actions, although there are exceptions to this. It is this
              acceptance of the legal consequences that has been influential in
              changing both laws and wider attitudes towards civil disobedience.

              Historically, there are a number of civil disobedience movements
              of significance. Henry David Thoreau's 1849 essay Civil
              Disobedience, entitled 'Resistance to Civil Government', is a key
              text. In this well-known essay, Thoreau argues for a priority of
              individual conscience over government legislation. Before and
              during the American Civil War, citizens who helped runaway slaves
              were acting in breach of the law, but they were following the
              dictates of their consciences. Thoreau himself resisted the
              imposition of taxes that would be used to fund the US war against
              Mexico, and was briefly imprisoned for his refusal. Despite this,
              he was relatively privileged compared to those actively resisting
              slavery. He was not pursued vigorously by the state because of his
              actions. Some of his neighbors actually paid the taxes on his
              behalf, which led to his release, but he protested even against
              this intervention.

            <p>
              Mohandas (later 'Mahatma', or 'Great Soul') Gandhi was influenced
              by Thoreau and was one of the most important 20th-century
              proponents of civil disobedience. In South Africa, he led
              campaigns against restrictions on immigration, and later, on
              racial discrimination. Upon returning to India, he organized a
              long series of campaigns against British rule. For Gandhi, the
              notion of civil disobedience was strongly linked to his wider
              philosophy and religious beliefs. He advocated a policy of
              non-violence, believing that the use of violence against the
              British would simply replace one source of oppression with
              another. His view was that if he employed violence to achieve his
              aims, it would be harder to resist the desire for revenge once the
              British had been overcome. He therefore believed that if India was
              to be truly independent and genuinely peaceful, the means used to
              achieve those goals had to be consistent with his belief in
              non-violence. In some cases, however, Gandhi's civil disobedience
              campaigns were called off because they had led to violence. The
              British Viceroy, Lord Irwin, was aware that forcible suppression
              of the movement would lead to widespread violence, so the protests
              became a factor in the British decision to remove themselves from
              the governing of India, albeit after a long struggle.

              In the United States, under the leadership of Martin Luther King,
              civil disobedience became a powerful part of the Civil Rights
              movement. In the face of continuing racial segregation, even after
              the Supreme Court ruled that separate schools for black and white
              children were not equal, activists adopted a series of tactics to
              resist the law. In 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks refused
              to give up her seat to a white person on a bus - a protest that
              led to a boycott of the bus company by supporters of the Civil
              Rights movement. The aim was to target the company's revenues. The
              boycott was a success, and the US Supreme Court eventually ruled
              that the local law requiring segregation on Montgomery buses was
              unconstitutional.

              In the UK, the suffragette movement of the early 20th century
              campaigned to get the vote for women. Their tactics included
              disruption of daily life through civil disobedience, such as
              chaining themselves to railings, pouring chemicals into mailboxes
              to damage the mail, breaking windows and even arson. The mass
              civil disobedience of the suffragettes and the attempts to
              suppress their activities led to around 1,000 imprisonments. Many
              of them went on hunger strike in prison, which led to the
              authorities force-feeding them. Faced with continuing protests,
              bad publicity from the suffering of women when force-fed, and
              unwillingness to release the women, the government felt forced to
              pass the Prisoner's Temporary Discharge Act in 1913. This allowed
              the temporary discharge of prisoners who were so weakened by
              hunger striking that they were at risk of death, but meant that
              they could be re-imprisoned to serve out the rest of their
              sentence once they had recovered. This law became known as the
              'Cat and Mouse Act' and was criticized as inhumane. Nonetheless,
              one of the important legacies of the suffragette movement was the
              lesson that the vote could be won, and the law changed, by direct
              action, rather than purely by constitutional means.

              A number of environmentalist groups have employed methods of civil
              disobedience in opposition to nuclear weaponry and power stations.
              For instance, in 1982 a group of women began a peace camp outside
              the Greenham Common Royal Air Force base in Berkshire, England,
              protesting against the siting of 96 cruise missiles there. In
              1983, during demonstrations which aimed to disrupt the
              transportation of the missiles into the base, more than 750 women
              were arrested for 'obstructing the highway'. A series of similar
              actions over the coming years resulted in more arrests, including
              one of 200 women on a single day in December 1983. The missiles
              were in fact installed on the base, but the campaigners continued
              to surround it until the weapons were removed and the airbase
              closed. The peace camp came to an end in 2000.

              Today, civil disobedience continues to be a significant form of
              political activism, with examples ranging from mass protests
              against government corruption to individuals refusing to comply
              with laws they believe are unjust. Many middle-class individuals,
              who might not have been politically active previously, may engage
              in this form of protest, sometimes when conventional political
              means have proven unsuccessful. In contemporary society, the use
              of social media to report civil disobedience may mean there is
              greater awareness of these protests, making it more difficult for
              authorities to dismiss or suppress civil disobedience, or to
              control the narrative surrounding such events. Thus, while the
              tactics of civil disobedience have not changed radically since the
              early 20th century, their impact may be amplified by 21st century
              technology.

              Creating a healthier workplace environment results in reduced
              absenteeism and staff turnover, increased employee engagement, and
              improved morale, which can all contribute to greater productivity.
              Research has shown that supporting your employees to be healthier
              and happier at work does not need to be expensive.

              Encourage healthier eating by replacing soda with filtered tap
              water. Make fruit accessible in common areas where employees
              gather. Consider installing a fridge to enable employees to store
              their healthy meals brought from home instead of buying fast food
              options.

            <p>
              Consider creating safe storage areas for bikes to encourage
              employees to cycle to work. If your building has the space,
              install showers for employees who wish to exercise before work, at
              lunch, or on their way home from work.

              Encourage participation in local and national physical activity

              throughout the year, such as 'National Walking Month' or 'Cycle to
              Work Day'. Get onboard with these campaigns, which often have free
              resources to help get your employees involved.

              Printing is a process for reproducing images and text by applying
              color under pressure to paper or other materials. It encompasses a
              number of different techniques that have been practiced for
              hundreds of years. They include woodcuts, engravings, etchings,
              lithographs and screen-printing, all of which require specialist
              skills and equipment, and all of which have been used, and are
              still used, by artists to produce high-quality prints of their
              work.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="paragraph">
            <p>
              In the early days of printing, woodcuts and copper plate
              engravings were the principal techniques. A copper-plate engraving
              was made by cutting the image into the metal. When the plate was
              inked, the ink remained in the sunken lines of the image and was
              transferred to paper when the plate and paper were squeezed
              together in a press, leaving an impression of the image. As the
              paper was pressed into the lines of the engraving, a ridge of
              paper was raised on the back of the print, and the ink stood proud
              of the paper. A print expert would look for these signs to
              identify a copper engraving. As the copper plate had to be
              engraved in reverse – in other words, the image had to be cut into
              the plate backwards compared to the way it would be printed out –
              the process had technical difficulties.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="paragraph">
            <p>
              Nevertheless, copper engraving became more and more sophisticated
              over time. In Italy in the early 16th century, Marcantonio
              Raimondi produced prints of unprecedented quality from engravings,
              which he was using to reproduce paintings. He realized that since
              the copper plate could be printed many times, the art of the great
              painters could become available to people who could not otherwise
              have afforded to see or purchase the originals. However, the labor
              involved in copper engraving was considerable, and engravings were
              still expensive, especially ones that were printed using colored
              inks. By the 17th century, only rulers and the very rich could
              afford to commission original prints from copper-plate engravers,
              and less wealthy people had to be satisfied with maps and pictures
              in books.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="paragraph">
            <p>
              Although the techniques of engraving were not in themselves
              scientifically sophisticated, they were used by scientists in
              communicating their ideas and discoveries. In the 18th century,
              biological illustrations usually started by drawing directly from
              the subject, and were valued according to their accuracy of
              representation. Their inclusion in scientific journals helped to
              promote the work of the featured scientists. In 1798, the Lombardy
              Academy of Science in Italy recommended that lithography should be
              used for scientific illustration. Unlike copper-plate engraving,
              stone lithography allows a wide range of tonal variations and an
              artist can draw directly onto the stone without the need for
              engraving. This innovation made print-making much faster; it meant
              that many more prints could be run off, and in time led to the
              emergence of mass-market magazines.

              Major advances came in the early 19th century with the
              introduction of lithography, which was invented in 1798 by Alois
              Senefelder. Senefelder had been looking for a cheap way to publish
              theatrical works, and found that he could use wax to draw on a
              stone plate, which was then treated with chemicals, so that when
              ink was applied to the stone, it stuck only to the areas where the
              drawing had been done. This enabled him to transfer his designs to
              paper by pressing them on the stone. This became a popular
              technique with artists, because they could draw directly onto the
              stone instead of having to use a printer as an intermediary.
              Famous artists like Manet, Degas and Picasso enthusiastically
              embraced lithography, and many artists today still use stone
              lithography to create prints of their own designs and artwork.
              With the continued development of lithography, color reproduction
              techniques advanced.

              By the early 20th century, photographic printing techniques had
              been refined to the point where it was possible to make excellent
              color reproductions of paintings. Print-making had declined as a
              medium for artists, although certain major artists continued to
              produce etchings and lithographs, using the form as a medium in
              its own right, rather than merely a way to reproduce an image. For
              example, the Spanish artist Goya created an entire sequence of
              prints, entitled 'Caprichos', which allowed him to express himself
              freely. Printmaking was an essential part of his output, and in
              total he produced some 270 prints. Developments in photography
              seemed to have made the artist-printmaker obsolete, but the growth
              of a mass consumer society, and with it the emergence of mass
              advertising in the early 20th century, meant that the skills of
              the printmaker were still in demand, especially in the form of
              screen-printing, which was a cheap way of making bold, striking
              posters.

              Screen-printing has a history that goes back to the earliest forms
              of stencil-making in China around 1000 years ago. From China, the
              craft spread to Japan, where the stencil technique was applied to
              fabric. The Japanese used human hair to create a mesh that
              supported the design. By the early 20th century, fabric was being
              used instead of hair, and squeegees replaced brushes for pushing
              the ink through the mesh. Today, most screen-printing is carried
              out using a photo stencil made from a light-sensitive gelatin,
              which is exposed to the image in a process similar to that used in
              photography. Parts of the gelatin become hardened when exposed to
              light, while the areas that remain in shadow can be washed away,
              allowing the ink to penetrate the screen and print onto the
              surface placed below. Most screen-printing is done on a commercial
              basis to mass-produce a specified image, although many artists do
              screen-printing as part of their practice.

              Contemporary artists use computer-aided printing of various kinds
              when they want to mass-produce their own work, or when they choose
              to work in that medium as part of their creative practice. Some
              artists continue to use traditional printing techniques such as
              linocuts, wood carving and lithography, delighting in the
              particularities of the chosen medium. And many contemporary
              artists combine old and new techniques or import images from one
              medium into another to create interesting effects.

              Although its primary purpose is reproductive, making prints is
              also a creative process, and artists and illustrators continue to
              use all of the techniques described above to produce
              limited-edition prints of their work. These are signed and
              numbered by the artist, and are sold through galleries in editions
              of 15 to 50 copies of each image. These days, such prints are
              highly regarded by art critics and collectors. Prints are no
              longer viewed as inferior to other art forms such as paintings or
              drawings, and they are purchased by major galleries and private
              collectors.

            <p>
              A screen print is made by pressing ink through a mesh, parts of
              which have been obscured by a stencil so that the ink only
              penetrates the open areas, creating an image on a surface placed
              beneath the mesh. The mesh, which is stretched tightly across a
              frame, is traditionally made of fabric, although metal or nylon
              may also be used. An artist starts the process by making a drawing
              or design, which is followed by the construction of a stencil to
              recreate the design. The stencil can be made in various ways, such
              as by cutting shapes from paper, or by painting parts of the
              screen with a liquid which dries and blocks the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              The technique of screen printing was first used in China. The
              Chinese used human hair to construct the mesh. A stencil was
              created, and ink forced through the mesh using a stiff brush. In
              the early 20th century, printers in the West began to use the
              technique. Modern stencils used in screen printing are typically
              made using photo-sensitive gelatins, which go hard when exposed to
              light. This allows very fine detail to be created.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some artists prefer to create stencils with a geometric pattern,
              which can be repeated to create a design, while others may prefer
              to work with photographic images. Because the screen can be used
              many times, it is easy to create multicolored prints by printing
              one color at a time, using a different screen for each color.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the process is part of what makes a screen print
              distinctive, artists also need to choose what surface to print on.
              Many artists choose newspaper, but other options include plastic,
              card or even knitwear.
