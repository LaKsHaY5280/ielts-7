          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 1-14</strong>,
          which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">Community Gardens</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          A community garden is a piece of land gardened collectively by a group
          of people. The land may be divided into individual plots or gardened
          as a whole by a group of people. Community gardens provide fresh
          produce and plants, neighborhood improvement, sense of community, and
          connection to the environment for the people involved.
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">Benefits of Community Gardens</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Community gardens offer numerous benefits to individuals and
          communities. They improve the quality of life for people involved,
          provide nutritious food, reduce family food costs, conserve resources,
          and create opportunities for recreation, exercise, therapy, and
          education.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Community gardens also preserve green space, create community
          development opportunities, reduce crime, beautify neighborhoods, and
          provide opportunities for intergenerational and cross-cultural
          connections. Gardens produce nutritious vegetables, enabling
          participants to save money on groceries. Gardeners may take produce
          home and many gardens also donate a portion of their harvest to food
          pantries.
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">Types of Community Gardens</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Neighborhood Gardens:</strong> These are the most common type
          of community garden, typically located on vacant lots divided into
          individual plots. These gardens beautify neighborhoods and provide
          recreation for residents.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Residential Gardens:</strong> Located at apartment complexes,
          townhouse communities, and mobile home parks, these gardens provide
          recreational and therapeutic opportunities for residents.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Institutional Gardens:</strong> These are gardens located at
          public or private organizations such as hospitals, businesses,
          prisons, schools, colleges, and retirement centers. They may provide
          therapy, education, recreation, or job training.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Demonstration Gardens:</strong> These gardens showcase
          techniques for landscaping, building soil health, or native plant
          gardening. They often serve as examples of environmental stewardship.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Food Bank Gardens:</strong> These are specifically created to
          grow food for food pantries and homeless shelters. They are often
          maintained by volunteers.
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">Starting a Community Garden</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Organize a Meeting</strong>
          <br />
          Determine whether a garden is really needed and wanted, what kind it
          should be, and who will be involved.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Form a Planning Committee</strong>
          <br />
          This group can help divide the work and increase support for the
          garden. The committee should represent the diversity of the community.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Identify Resources</strong>
          <br />
          Look within your community for resources, such as space, funding, and
          partnerships. Contact local municipal departments about available
          public lands, and approach landowners with vacant private parcels.
          Look for potential sponsors, particularly local businesses who may
          contribute money or materials.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Choose a Site</strong>
          <br />
          Consider these factors:
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mt-2">
            <li>At least six hours of daily sunlight</li>
            <li>Availability of water</li>
            <li>Proximity to gardeners' homes</li>
            <li>Access for equipment delivery</li>
            <li>Soil testing for contaminants</li>
            <li>Security from vandalism</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Prepare and Develop the Site</strong>
          <br />
          In most cases, the land will need considerable preparation, including
          debris removal, soil testing, and soil improvement.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Organize the Garden</strong>
          <br />
          Decide how many plots are desired and mark them clearly with permanent
          stakes. Paths should be at least 3 feet wide for accessibility. Areas
          used for group activities should be in a central location, with
          adequate shade and seating.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Establish Rules and Guidelines</strong>
          <br />
          Basic rules should cover:
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mt-2">
            <li>Membership fees</li>
            <li>Maintenance responsibilities</li>
            <li>Watering guidelines</li>
            <li>Tool storage</li>
            <li>Regular work days</li>
            <li>How to deal with vandalism or theft</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">
          Community Garden Success Story: Phoenix Community Garden
        </h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Phoenix Community Garden in Brooklyn, New York, demonstrates the
          positive impact gardens can have on communities. Started in a vacant
          lot in 2012, it now has over 30 individual plots and a shared herb
          garden. The garden has become a hub for neighbors to connect, children
          to learn about growing food, and for cross-cultural exchange among the
          diverse local residents.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In 2018, the garden added a rain water harvesting system and
          solar-powered lighting, making it more environmentally sustainable.
          Garden members hold monthly workdays, weekly farmers markets in
          summer, and educational workshops on gardening and cooking. Food not
          used by gardeners is donated to a local food pantry, providing fresh
          produce to those in need.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          "The garden has transformed not just this space, but our
          neighborhood," says Maria Rodriguez, garden coordinator. "People who
          never spoke to each other now work side by side. Children who had
          never seen a carrot growing now eagerly tend their own plants. We've
          seen reduced crime in the area, and increased property values. But
          most importantly, we've built a true community."
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">Challenges and Solutions</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Community gardens face challenges including securing land tenure,
          obtaining funding, maintaining volunteer engagement, and addressing
          environmental issues like soil contamination. Solutions include
          forming partnerships with municipalities and nonprofits, seeking
          grants, organizing regular events, and implementing proper soil
          testing and remediation when necessary.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Despite these challenges, community gardens continue to thrive and
          expand across cities and towns worldwide, demonstrating their value as
          green space, food sources, and community building tools.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          For more information on starting or joining a community garden in your
          area, contact your local extension office, parks and recreation
          department, or visit www.communitygarden.org.

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 15-27</strong>,
          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">A Guide to Executive Coaching</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Executive coaching, once viewed as a last-resort intervention for
          fixing problematic managers, has now become widely accepted as a
          leadership development tool for valued employees. A 2019 survey by the
          International Coach Federation found that 83% of organizations plan to
          expand their use of coaching in the next year, and executives who
          receive coaching report an average return on investment of six times
          the cost of coaching.
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">What is Executive Coaching?</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Executive coaching is a collaborative, personalized process designed
          to help leaders achieve specific professional goals. Unlike
          traditional training which delivers standardized content to groups,
          coaching is tailored to individual needs and focuses on sustainable
          behavioral change. A professional coach works one-on-one with an
          executive to enhance self-awareness, identify strengths and
          weaknesses, develop new skills, and implement strategies for
          improvement.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Coaching typically involves regular sessions over a period of three to
          twelve months. The process is confidential, allowing executives to
          openly discuss challenges they might not feel comfortable sharing with
          colleagues or superiors. Coaching is action-oriented and
          results-focused, with clear objectives and measurable outcomes.
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">
          When to Consider Executive Coaching
        </h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Organizations typically engage executive coaches in several scenarios:
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Leadership Development:</strong> Coaching helps high-potential
          employees prepare for greater responsibility, develop specific
          leadership competencies, and navigate transitions to new roles.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Performance Improvement:</strong> When a valued employee has
          specific performance issues, coaching can help identify root causes
          and develop strategies for improvement.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Organizational Change:</strong> During mergers, restructuring,
          or strategic shifts, coaching helps executives adapt to new
          circumstances and lead their teams through uncertainty.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Specialized Skill Development:</strong> Coaching can address
          specific skills gaps such as strategic thinking, emotional
          intelligence, communication, or conflict management.
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">The Coaching Process</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While approaches vary, most executive coaching follows a similar
          process:
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Assessment:</strong> The process begins with thorough
          assessment using interviews, psychometric tools, and often 360-degree
          feedback from colleagues. This creates a comprehensive picture of the
          executive's current strengths, challenges, and development
          opportunities.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Goal Setting:</strong> The coach and executive collaborate to
          establish clear, measurable goals for the coaching engagement. These
          should align with both organizational objectives and the executive's
          personal development needs.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Action Planning:</strong> Together, they develop specific
          strategies and action steps to achieve the established goals. This
          includes new behaviors to practice, skills to develop, and approaches
          to challenging situations.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Implementation:</strong> The executive implements the action
          plan in their daily work, with regular coaching sessions providing
          support, feedback, and course correction as needed.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Measurement and Review:</strong> Progress is regularly
          measured against established goals. This may include follow-up
          assessments, feedback from stakeholders, or specific performance
          metrics.
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">Selecting the Right Coach</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Finding the right match between coach and executive is crucial for
          success. Consider these factors when selecting a coach:
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Credentials and Experience:</strong> Look for coaches with
          recognized certifications (such as those from the International Coach
          Federation), relevant education, and experience coaching executives in
          similar roles or industries. However, industry-specific experience is
          less important than coaching skill and understanding of leadership
          challenges.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Approach and Methodology:</strong> Different coaches use
          different approaches. Some are more directive, others more reflective.
          Some emphasize psychological aspects, others focus on practical
          business challenges. The approach should match the executive's
          learning style and needs.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Chemistry and Trust:</strong> The executive and coach need to
          establish rapport and trust. Most coaches offer an initial
          consultation to assess this fit before committing to a coaching
          relationship.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Business Understanding:</strong> The coach should understand
          organizational dynamics and business realities to provide relevant
          guidance.
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">Maximizing Return on Investment</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Organizations can increase the effectiveness of executive coaching by:
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Setting Clear Objectives:</strong> Define what success looks
          like at the outset of the coaching engagement.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Ensuring Organizational Alignment:</strong> The coaching goals
          should support broader organizational objectives.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Involving Key Stakeholders:</strong> While maintaining
          confidentiality, involve the executive's manager in setting objectives
          and reviewing progress.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Creating Supportive Conditions:</strong> Ensure the executive
          has opportunities to practice new skills and behaviors.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Measuring Results:</strong> Establish metrics to evaluate the
          impact of coaching, which might include improved performance reviews,
          team engagement scores, or specific business outcomes.
        </p>

          Case Study: Transformational Leadership Coaching
        </h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Sarah Chen, newly appointed Chief Operating Officer at a mid-sized
          technology company, engaged an executive coach to help her transition
          from her previous role heading product development. While technically
          brilliant, Sarah needed to develop broader leadership skills to
          oversee multiple departments.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Through 360-degree feedback, Sarah discovered that while her teams
          respected her expertise, they found her communication style overly
          direct and sometimes dismissive of non-technical perspectives. With
          her coach, Sarah developed specific strategies to improve her
          listening skills, demonstrate appreciation for diverse viewpoints, and
          articulate a compelling vision that resonated beyond the technical
          teams.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Six months later, employee engagement scores in her division had
          improved by 24%, cross-departmental collaboration had increased, and
          the executive team reported that Sarah was contributing more
          effectively to strategic discussions. Sarah herself reported greater
          confidence in her leadership approach and better work-life balance as
          she learned to delegate more effectively.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          "The coaching helped me see blind spots I didn't know I had," Sarah
          said. "I'm now leading in a way that leverages my technical strengths
          while bringing out the best in my entire team."
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">Conclusion</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Executive coaching has evolved from remedial intervention to strategic
          investment in leadership development. When properly implemented with
          clear goals, appropriate coach selection, and organizational support,
          it delivers significant benefits for both the individual and the
          organization. As business environments become increasingly complex and
          demanding, personalized development through coaching offers executives
          the support they need to lead effectively.

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">The Beaver: Nature's Engineer</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          For millions of years, beavers have shaped the landscape of North
          America and Europe through their unique building activities, creating
          wetland habitats that benefit countless other species. Known as
          "nature's engineers," these rodents possess remarkable abilities to
          modify their environment through dam construction, lodge building, and
          canal digging. Once nearly extinct due to overhunting for their fur,
          beavers are now making a comeback, and scientists are increasingly
          recognizing their crucial role in ecosystem management and
          restoration.
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">The Beaver's Natural History</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Beavers are the second-largest rodents in the world (after capybaras),
          with adults typically weighing 16-32 kg (35-70 pounds) and measuring
          up to 1.2 meters (4 feet) in length, including their distinctive flat,
          scaly tails. They belong to the genus Castor, with two extant species:
          the North American beaver (Castor canadensis) and the Eurasian beaver
          (Castor fiber). These species are remarkably similar in appearance and
          behavior despite having evolved separately for over 7 million years.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Perfectly adapted for their semi-aquatic lifestyle, beavers have
          webbed hind feet, large incisor teeth for cutting wood, transparent
          eyelids that function as underwater goggles, and dense fur that
          provides insulation in cold water. Their most recognizable feature—the
          broad, flat tail—serves multiple functions: as a rudder while
          swimming, a prop for balance while cutting trees, a fat storage
          reserve, and a warning device when slapped against the water's surface
          to alert other beavers of danger.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Beavers are primarily nocturnal and are devoted to family life. They
          typically live in colonies consisting of a monogamous adult pair and
          their offspring from the current and previous year, with family units
          averaging 6-8 individuals. Young beavers usually leave the colony at
          two years of age to establish their own territories. With few natural
          predators as adults, beavers can live up to 10 years in the wild and
          sometimes longer in protected environments.
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">Masters of Construction</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          What truly sets beavers apart from other wildlife is their
          extraordinary building behavior. Beavers build dams across streams to
          create ponds that provide protection from predators, access to food
          during winter, and a water route for transporting building materials.
          Using branches, mud, stones, and other available materials, they
          construct dams that can span more than 100 meters (328 feet) in length
          and stand up to 3 meters (10 feet) tall. Beaver dams are remarkably
          durable structures that can last for decades with regular maintenance.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Within their ponds, beavers build dome-shaped lodges with underwater
          entrances that lead to dry living chambers above the water line. These
          shelters protect them from predators and weather extremes. The living
          chamber is kept clean, dry, and well-ventilated through a small air
          hole at the top of the lodge. In winter, the wet walls of the lodge
          freeze, creating a fortress-like structure that predators find nearly
          impossible to penetrate.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Perhaps most impressive is beavers' ability to construct water canals,
          sometimes extending hundreds of meters from their pond. These canals,
          typically about 1 meter wide and 0.5 meters deep, allow them to
          transport food and building materials with minimal effort and reduced
          exposure to land predators. Some canal systems include series of small
          dams that maintain water levels across changing terrain—a feat of
          engineering that demonstrates an intuitive understanding of
          hydraulics.
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">Ecological Benefits</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Far from being mere curiosities, beaver modifications to the landscape
          provide numerous ecological benefits. Their dams and ponds create
          wetland habitats that support remarkable biodiversity. Research has
          documented significant increases in the number of bird species,
          amphibians, fish, and invertebrates in areas colonized by beavers. One
          study in Wyoming found that beaver ponds supported 75 species of
          waterbirds compared to just 18 species in nearby undammed streams.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Beaver dams improve water quality by trapping sediment and filtering
          out pollutants. The ponds they create recharge groundwater supplies,
          raise the water table in the surrounding area, and help maintain
          stream flows during dry periods. This water storage capacity makes
          beaver-modified landscapes significantly more resistant to drought,
          and their ponds can act as natural firebreaks during forest fires. The
          dams also slow water flow, reducing downstream flooding after heavy
          rainfall.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In cold regions, beaver ponds can provide crucial winter habitat for
          fish when other parts of streams freeze solid. The warmer, deeper
          water of beaver ponds offers refuge for species like trout that might
          otherwise perish. Additionally, beavers' tree-cutting and damming
          activities create forest openings that promote habitat diversity and
          stimulate new growth, benefiting species that require different forest
          stages.
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">Historical Decline and Recovery</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Historically, beavers were among the most widespread and numerous
          mammals in North America, with population estimates ranging from 60 to
          400 million before European colonization. In Europe, they were
          similarly abundant. However, intensive trapping for their fur,
          waterproof and ideal for hats and coats, led to their near extinction
          in many regions by the early 1900s. The North American beaver was
          reduced to perhaps 100,000 animals, while the Eurasian beaver survived
          only in small, scattered populations across Europe and Asia.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The 20th century saw a remarkable recovery for both species thanks to
          hunting regulations, reintroduction programs, and natural expansion
          from surviving populations. Today, North American beavers number
          between 10-15 million, while Eurasian beaver populations continue to
          grow across their native range. This recovery, although impressive,
          still leaves beaver numbers at a fraction of their historical
          abundance.
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">
          Beavers and Modern Water Management
        </h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As climate change brings more intense droughts and floods to many
          regions, the beaver's water-storing abilities are gaining new
          appreciation among scientists and land managers. The term
          "beaver-powered" has emerged to describe restoration projects that
          either directly reintroduce beavers or mimic their dam-building
          effects to restore degraded watersheds.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In the western United States, beaver reintroductions have successfully
          restored eroded stream channels, raised water tables, and revitalized
          riparian vegetation. In the United Kingdom, beaver trials in Devon
          have demonstrated the animals' ability to reduce downstream flooding
          by up to 30% during heavy rain events. These projects highlight how
          working with nature—specifically, harnessing beavers' instinctive
          behaviors—can provide cost-effective solutions to water management
          challenges.
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold mt-4">The Human-Beaver Relationship</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Despite their ecological benefits, beavers' construction activities
          sometimes conflict with human land uses. Flooding from beaver dams can
          damage roads, agricultural fields, and other infrastructure. Their
          tree-cutting can impact valuable timber or ornamental trees. These
          conflicts have traditionally been addressed through lethal control,
          but more coexistence strategies are now being implemented.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Flow devices, often called "beaver deceivers," can regulate water
          levels in beaver ponds to prevent unwanted flooding. Tree guards
          protect valuable trees while allowing beavers to remain in an area.
          Increasingly, communities are finding that accommodating and managing
          beaver activity is more cost-effective and beneficial than removing
          them entirely.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Indigenous peoples across North America have long recognized the
          beaver's ecological importance and incorporated the animal into their
          cultural practices and stories. The beaver's recent recovery offers an
          opportunity to integrate this traditional knowledge with modern
          scientific understanding, developing a more harmonious relationship
          between humans and these remarkable ecosystem engineers.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          As we face unprecedented environmental challenges, the humble beaver
          offers a compelling model of how a single species can positively
          transform landscapes. Their recovery represents not just a
          conservation success story, but a valuable opportunity to rethink our
          approach to ecosystem management and restoration.
