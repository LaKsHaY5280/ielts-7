          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 1-13</strong>,
          which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">Sharing, but with whom?</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          By the age of nine months, most babies are experts at building up
          their social circle. They reward their parents' friends with smiles
          and squeals while saving tears and frowns for those they don't like
          the look of. They are learning to reach some form of emotional
          synchronicity with the wider world.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          It's a formative developmental period. Yet psychologist Michael
          Tomasello wanted to know more about the point in human development
          when babies learn to collaborate and share. He carried out a study in
          Germany that involved babies aged from 9 to 18 months encountering a
          succession of different scenarios. For example, a researcher would
          play with blocks in front of the child and then knock down the stack.
          Babies of under 14 months would, he found, generally look on
          impassively. Those over 14 months, however, would show concern, try to
          comfort the adult, and even help rebuild the stack.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In another experiment, an adult pretended not to be able to reach a
          ball while the baby looked on. Again, babies under 14 months showed no
          reaction, but older ones helped by crawling to the ball and picking it
          up. Tomasello's research is the first hard evidence that while babies
          of 9 months cooperate with their parents, babies of 14 to 18 months
          cooperate with strangers too, and on tasks they've never seen before.
          'This sort of thing is not learned,' he says. 'It seems to come
          naturally.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          This view opposes the longstanding idea that very young humans are
          entirely selfish. In fact, scientists have found that, by their first
          birthdays, babies do appreciate the importance of another's
          intentions, something which Tomasello says is the basic psychological
          process needed for collaboration. And until now, there was no known
          mechanism that could help explain child cooperation. The idea that
          empathy is innate explains a lot. It could be our capacity to identify
          with others that makes humans such a successfully collaborative
          species.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The next stage in Tomasello's research is to see whether babies also
          understand the concept of fairness. His team carried out research in
          which babies of just 3 months were shown animations of simple shapes
          either cooperating or being aggressive or helpful or obstructive.
          These very young subjects showed a distinct preference in looking at
          the more helpful shapes. But perhaps the most remarkable experiment
          was one in which 15-month-old babies had the opportunity to witness an
          adult struggling to try to get into a cupboard with his hands full.
          Though babies this age will often help a stranger with simple tasks,
          they are not generally given the opportunity to observe someone who
          doesn't realise they need help, and might not be expected to respond.
          Yet these subjects frequently took the initiative to help the adult.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The study of child development suggests that empathy is innate. But
          then how can we explain the likes of King Leopold II of Belgium (a
          cruel despot in Africa), Adolf Hitler, or the type of person who
          enjoys torturing others? Are they just exceptional individuals who
          have unlearned empathy? Frans de Waal, a professor of primate
          behaviour at Emory University in Atlanta, believes indeed the problem
          is not switching on empathy, it's switching it off. Normal humans have
          evolved a very strong tendency to empathise with others, irrespective
          of identity of the other individual. However, there are various
          conditions, such as the social pressure to conform (as in Nazi
          Germany), where a sort of empathy is switched off. Any discussion of
          empathy must consider both the degree to which it is intrinsic to
          humans and the factors that make humans turn away from it.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Experiments using painful stimuli have shown that the same areas of
          the brain are activated whether men are receiving pain or observing
          others receiving it. However, when asked to rate the level of this
          pain, the men gave lower ratings for others' pain than for their own.
          This makes evolutionary sense. If people felt others' pain as severely
          as they do their own, surely they would never be able to function in
          emergency situations where others are suffering, or indeed in any
          situation where difficult actions need to be taken for the common
          good.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          A study in the Netherlands, which enables us to understand more of
          this, examined brain activity in adults who watched a game of
          ball-tossing. The subjects could see three people playing with the
          ball, with one player deliberately excluded by the other two. The
          subjects' brain activity was monitored by a brain scanning technique.
          Then the subjects were invited to join in the game. As we might
          expect, they threw the ball to the isolated player more often than to
          the other (excluding) players, showing a greater degree of empathy
          towards the less fortunate player. While watching the exclusion
          scenario, the areas of the subjects' brains that process emotion and
          physical pain had lit up on the scan – along with another area. This
          was the pre-motor cortex, which is activated when a person is planning
          a physical movement. So not only were the subjects registering the
          pain of exclusion, but they were also planning to help the excluded
          player. Empathy, it seems, is linked to action.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But this notion that we literally 'feel' for others is relatively new
          to science, as a result of such brain scan research. For most of the
          20th century, standard neuroscience held that the brain and emotions
          such as empathy were in separate domains. Emotions, it was thought,
          were physically represented only in the autonomic nervous system – the
          nerves that control involuntary functions such as heartbeats, sneezes,
          and digestion. Then in 1994, neuroscientist Antonio Damasio published
          a groundbreaking book, Descartes' Error, which showed that people with
          damage to the part of the brain where emotions are processed found it
          very hard to make decisions. Damasio's research provided support for
          the idea that what we call 'thoughts' are actually feelings.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But this notion does not have universal acceptance, and empathy itself
          remains difficult to study. There is a world of difference between
          empathising with the stress of exclusion from a ball game, for
          example, and the trauma of a major disaster. As Dr Tania Singer, one
          of the leading researchers in empathy at University College, London,
          notes: 'We still don't know whether these empathic brain responses are
          specific to the infliction of pain in social contexts, or whether they
          also extend to other emotions such as disgust or fear.'

          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">The Discovery of Uranus</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In 1781, astronomer William Herschel was looking through his telescope
          as part of his project to chart all the stars visible from Earth. As
          he was observing, he noticed what he thought was a comet. It was an
          object which moved against the background stars, but did not have the
          fuzzy appearance or the tail that is characteristic of comets. After
          following its motion for a number of nights, Herschel sent his
          observations to other scientists, who were also unable to identify the
          object as a previously known celestial body. A few months later it was
          determined that Herschel had discovered not a comet, but a new planet
          - which eventually was named Uranus, after the ancient Greek god of
          the sky.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Although Uranus is one of the giant gas planets in our solar system -
          about 50 times the size of Earth - it is so far away that it is barely
          visible to the naked eye, and only under very good conditions. It
          would have been observed by many early astronomers, but since these
          observers didn't recognise the object as a planet, it was usually
          classified as a star. In fact, in his work The True System of the
          World, published in 1740, scientist Thomas Wright suggested that faint
          blurs of light observed through telescopes might in fact be distant
          planetary systems, but his ideas were too advanced for his time and
          were not investigated by the scientific community.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In 1690, the first known observation of Uranus as something other than
          a fixed star was made by the English astronomer John Flamsteed, who
          catalogued it as a star. Flamsteed observed Uranus at least six times.
          Seventy years later, a French astronomer named Pierre Lemonnier also
          recorded the planet's position a number of times between 1750 and
          1769, but on each occasion, he also failed to recognise the object as
          a planet.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There is evidence that normal people had noticed Uranus much earlier
          than that. Ancient Greek and Chinese texts suggest that people could
          sometimes see Uranus, despite the planet's dimness. It is now thought
          that the planet was just at the limit of what could be seen by human
          eyes, and would disappear from view when atmospheric conditions were
          not ideal. Some researchers claim that the Babylonians made
          observations of Uranus, and that the oldest reliable sighting of
          Uranus was by the Greek astronomer Hipparchos in 128 B.C.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          With the publication of his Almagest star catalogue in the 2nd Century
          A.D., the influential Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy appears to have
          included the coordinates of Uranus as a star. The planet was also
          recorded by a number of Arabic astronomers in the Middle Ages.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          It is sometimes said that Uranus was first identified as a planet by
          the amateur astronomer William Herschel. Although this is technically
          correct, it is unfair, since Herschel had not initially realised that
          he had discovered a planet either. It was his subsequent
          correspondence with a colleague, Nevil Maskelyne, which led to the
          realisation that his 'comet' was actually a planet. Herschel, though,
          obtained all the credit, something which seemed to please him greatly,
          as it led to his appointment as The King's Astronomer, even though he
          was not even a professional astronomer, but a musician.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          So why is Uranus so hard to see? It's considerably larger than the
          Earth, but much further away. The two planets are separated by up to 3
          billion kilometers. The great distance means that Uranus receives much
          less light from the sun than our planet, and because it doesn't
          produce light of its own, the sunlight it reflects towards the Earth
          is much weaker than light reflected by closer planets.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Another factor is that Uranus, like other gas giants such as Jupiter
          and Saturn, doesn't have a solid surface. It consists of a solid core
          surrounded by a gaseous outer layer, which is composed of about 83 per
          cent hydrogen, 15 per cent helium and 2 per cent methane. The methane
          absorbs the red spectrum of sunlight, giving the planet a blue-green
          colour, and making it even harder to see at a distance.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Uranus has been visited by just one space probe, Voyager 2, in the
          1980s. It transmitted back pictures of a rather boring, featureless
          planet, with a uniform blue-green appearance. Though not as
          spectacular as its neighbour Saturn, with its magnificent rings,
          Uranus also possesses a system of rings - thirteen in all, though they
          are very faint. However, a new study by astronomers at the University
          of California has revealed a surprising fact: Uranus does not just
          rotate predictably, like most other planets in our solar system, but
          tumbles around erratically, like a football after it's been kicked.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          This is because Uranus has an extreme axis of rotation - it's tilted
          by 98 degrees, which means that one of its poles always points roughly
          towards the sun. All other planets spin rather like a top, but Uranus
          rolls around its orbit rather like a ball. Now, researchers are
          suggesting that this strange rotation is due to the fact that Uranus
          was struck by a huge object, possibly as large as the Earth. The
          collision must have occurred shortly after the solar system was
          formed, and it seems that Uranus has never recovered from it.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There have been calls from scientists for a new unmanned mission to
          Uranus, as there is so much we still don't know about the planet.
          Space organisations are considering one such mission, tentatively
          called the Uranus Orbiter and Probe. But there are no concrete plans
          to visit the planet again at present, due to the vast distance that
          would need to be covered, and the enormous costs involved. Thus, for
          the foreseeable future, our knowledge of the planet will continue to
          depend on our Earth-based telescopes.

          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">The Origin of Laughter</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Laughter consists of two parts – a set of gestures and the production
          of a sound. The brain forces a regular, staccato noise. When we laugh,
          our arterial blood pressure increases, our facial colour darkens, the
          whole brain receives an electrical stimulation and the heart rate
          rises to 120 beats per minute. Laughter is a pleasant feeling, but it
          seems non-sensical: it involves the muscles of both happiness (the
          zygomatic major) and those of grief. The body is therefore obliged to
          react to the feeling that all is well, and also its opposite.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          When did laughter begin? Is it something we do as humans, or does it
          have biological prerequisites which we find in other species? Human
          laughter has been found by anthropologists in even the remotest
          cultures, including those which had never been exposed to Western
          culture. And the human facial expression of enjoyment corresponds, to
          a high degree, to the 'play face' found in our closest primate
          ancestors – chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. This play face can
          be seen in the youngest primates, is muscularly controlled in the same
          way as in humans, and serves a similar social function of bonding
          between members of the species.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Where, then, is the dividing line between us and our primate
          ancestors? Professor of Psychology Marina Davila-Ross of Portsmouth
          University made what is considered the first evolutionary analysis of
          primate laughter. 'The great apes have a similar facial expression
          when they are playing – they show their teeth in a grin, their eyes
          are bright, they pant excitedly,' she says. 'I present young
          chimpanzees with audio recordings of all the other ape species'
          'laughter', and they preferred to go on playing when they heard
          another of their own species laugh.' It seems, then, that the
          evolution of laughter in humans was a pre-existing ability. But humans
          are different from all of the other species, according to Professor
          Michael Owren of Georgia State University in the US. 'Their laugh is
          kind of a breathy exhalation and inhalation. It sounds like a pant
          laugh, kind of similar to a dog's panting. Human laughter has been
          ritualised. It has become much more stereotyped, much more rhythmic
          and much more complicated acoustically.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The creation of the laugh as we know it is to do with the fact that
          the human larynx moved downwards as we began to walk upright, and our
          brains started to increase in size. The laugh became something more
          refined. 'Our laughter is a vocalisation which evolved as a way of
          signalling positive emotion to others. That's why it became rhythmic
          and complicated,' says Owren. But this analysis raises a new question.
          If the motivation is simply to communicate happiness, then why is
          laughter so complex, with both positive and negative muscular
          movements involved? And why do we go into this strange 'second state'?
          The answer lies in the realm of neuro-psychology.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Robert Provine of the University of Maryland identified the
          evolutionary basis of humour and laughter. He found that the modern
          human brain has an ancient neural circuit that it uses exclusively for
          laughter. It also has a more recently evolved circuit in a different
          region, the cerebral cortex, which deals with complex thought. So the
          reason that we are convulsed when we laugh and go into a kind of
          temporary madness, Provine suggested, is that we are triggering a very
          primitive circuit that temporarily takes over from our more rational,
          higher brain. And probably the reason for the involvement of pain is
          similar. 'Laughter is a kind of explosion, with a beginning but no
          well-defined end,' says Provine. 'There's no real way of stopping it
          once it gets going, and it is a kind of mini-seizure.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Evolutionary psychologists and neurologists are now converging on a
          theory about the development of laughter. The idea is that one way in
          which the brain evolved was that elements of emotional regulation were
          added to cognitive awareness of the world around us. This became more
          pronounced as humans began to band together in ever-larger social
          groups. 'The human brain doubled in size in two million years,' says
          neuro-psychologist Paul MacLean of Stanford University. One of the
          primary causes of all this growth was the need to keep track of social
          awareness in an environment where the individual and the group had to
          be balanced. How so? Well, the argument goes that the explosion of
          social data and social management was a major trigger for expanding
          the brain's activity.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Professor Sophie Scott of University College, London has made a
          connection between laughter in primates and tickling, which works in a
          very similar way. 'When you tickle primates, they have the same
          reaction as humans,' she says. 'They push you away at the same time as
          they seem to want more.' She adds that tickling animals in the paw or
          stomach is connected to knowing where they are vulnerable. The play
          appears to be a rehearsal for real situations. So the real beneficial
          feature of tickling may be that it proves harmlessness while focusing
          on vulnerability. It tells the tickled creature that the tickler is
          someone they can trust. So when something switches from vulnerability
          to harmlessness, the play face – which is a reassuring grin with
          panting – instinctively follows.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Scott goes further. In modern humans, she suggests, laughter has
          developed into a much more subtle signaling system. It's true that
          when we live in close social spaces we use laughter to bond with those
          we want as friends. But the sound of the laugh has developed another
          social function. 'Laughter is a fast social emotion in humans,' says
          Scott. 'A real belly laugh goes "Ha-ha-ha-ha" in a regular rhythm at
          about four laughs per second. When we do it, other people can't help
          but be infected by it.' Brain scans show that people hear the sound,
          process its meaning, and their bodies move in response, all in less
          than half a second. 'People do join in,' she says. 'We've shown it in
          the lab. Putting subjects in a brain scanner, it's hard to get them to
          stay still when they hear laughter.'

          But to discover the function of 'emotional contagion', as
          psychologists now call it, various uncertainties need to be examined.
          Some theories suggest that when laughter is emotive, it reinforces
          social bonding, and when it's cognitive and occurs in response to
          wordplay, for example, it can have a distancing effect. Emotive
          laughter is cross-cultural whereas cognitive laughter is often lost in
          translation. But the larger purpose may simply be that both increase
          control in the flow of information and social exchange. Scott's
          research on laughter is very much a work in progress. She has found
          that women 'laugh much more than men in social interactions', which
          appears to point to the link between laughter and bonding. With its
          breath control issue, she believes that laughter may have been a major
          factor in the development of speech.
