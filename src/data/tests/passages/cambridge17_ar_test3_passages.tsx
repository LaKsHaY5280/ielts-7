        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">The thylacine</h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The extinct thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian tiger, was a
          marsupial* that bore a superficial resemblance to a dog. Its most
          distinguishing feature was the 13-19 dark brown stripes over its back,
          beginning at the rear of the body and extending onto the tail. The
          thylacine's average nose-to-tail length for adult males was 162.6 cm,
          compared to 153.7 cm for females.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The thylacine appeared to occupy most types of terrain except dense
          rainforest, with open eucalyptus forest thought to be its prime
          habitat. In terms of feeding, it was exclusively carnivorous, and its
          stomach was muscular with an ability to distend so that it could eat
          large amounts of food at one time, probably an adaptation to
          compensate for long periods when hunting was unsuccessful and food
          scarce. The thylacine was not a fast runner and probably caught its
          prey by exhausting it during a long pursuit. During long-distance
          chases, thylacines were likely to have relied more on scent than any
          other sense. They emerged to hunt during the evening, night and early
          morning and tended to retreat to the hills and forest for shelter
          during the day. Despite the common name 'tiger', the thylacine had a
          shy, nervous temperament. Although mainly nocturnal, it was sighted
          moving during the day and some individuals were even recorded basking
          in the sun.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The thylacine had an extended breeding season from winter to spring,
          with indications that some breeding took place throughout the year.
          The thylacine, like all marsupials, was tiny and hairless when born.
          Newborns crawled into the pouch on the belly of their mother, and
          attached themselves to one of the four teats, remaining there for up
          to three months. When old enough to leave the pouch, the young stayed
          in a lair such as a deep rocky cave, well-hidden nest or hollow log,
          whilst the mother hunted.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Approximately 4,000 years ago, the thylacine was widespread throughout
          New Guinea and most of mainland Australia, as well as the island of
          Tasmania. The most recent, well-dated occurrence of a thylacine on the
          mainland is a carbon-dated fossil from Murray Cave in Western
          Australia, which is around 3,100 years old. Its extinction coincided
          closely with the arrival of wild dogs called dingoes in Australia and
          a similar predator in New Guinea. Dingoes never reached Tasmania, and
          most scientists see this as the main reason for the thylacine's
          survival there.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The dramatic decline of the thylacine in Tasmania, which began in the
          1830s and continued for a century, is generally attributed to the
          relentless efforts of sheep farmers and bounty hunters** with
          shotguns. While this determined campaign undoubtedly played a large
          part, it is likely that various other factors also contributed to the
          decline and eventual extinction of the species. These include
          competition with wild dogs introduced by European settlers, loss of
          habitat along with the disappearance of prey species, and a
          distemper-like disease which may also have affected the thylacine.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There was only one successful attempt to breed a thylacine in
          captivity, at Melbourne Zoo in 1899. This was despite the large
          numbers that went through some zoos, particularly London Zoo and
          Tasmania's Hobart Zoo. The famous naturalist John Gould foresaw the
          thylacine's demise when he published his <em>Mammals of Australia</em>{" "}
          between 1848 and 1863, writing, 'The numbers of this singular animal
          will speedily diminish, extermination will have its full sway, and it
          will then, like the wolf of England and Scotland, be recorded as an
          animal of the past.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          However, there seems to have been little public pressure to preserve
          the thylacine, nor was much concern expressed by scientists at the
          decline of this species in the decades that followed. A notable
          exception was T.T. Flynn, Professor of Biology at the University of
          Tasmania. In 1914, he was sufficiently concerned about the scarcity of
          the thylacine to suggest that some should be captured and placed on a
          small island. But it was not until 1929, with the species on the very
          edge of extinction, that Tasmania's Animals and Birds Protection Board
          passed a motion protecting thylacines only for the month of December,
          which was thought to be their prime breeding season. The last known
          wild thylacine to be killed was shot by a farmer in the north-east of
          Tasmania in 1930, leaving just captive specimens. Official protection
          of the species by the Tasmanian government was introduced in July
          1936, 59 days before the last known individual died in Hobart Zoo on
          7th September, 1936.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There have been numerous expeditions and searches for the thylacine
          over the years, none of which has produced definitive evidence that
          thylacines still exist. The species was declared extinct by the
          Tasmanian government in 1986.

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Palm oil</h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>A</strong>
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Palm oil is an edible oil derived from the fruit of the African oil
          palm tree, and is currently the most consumed vegetable oil in the
          world. It's almost certainly in the soap we wash with in the morning,
          the sandwich we have for lunch, and the biscuits we snack on during
          the day. Why is palm oil so attractive for manufacturers? Primarily
          because its unique properties – such as remaining solid at room
          temperature – make it an ideal ingredient for long-term preservation,
          allowing many packaged foods on supermarket shelves to have 'best
          before' dates of months, even years, into the future.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>B</strong>
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Many farmers have seized the opportunity to maximise the planting of
          oil palm trees. Between 1990 and 2012, the global land area devoted to
          growing oil palm trees grew from 6 to 17 million hectares, now
          accounting for around ten percent of total cropland in the entire
          world. From a mere two million tonnes of palm oil being produced
          annually globally 50 years ago, there are now around 60 million tonnes
          produced every single year, a figure looking likely to double or even
          triple by the middle of the century.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>C</strong>
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          However, there are multiple reasons why conservationists cite the
          rapid spread of oil palm plantations as a major concern. There are
          countless news stories of deforestation, habitat destruction and
          dwindling species populations, all as a direct result of land clearing
          to establish oil palm tree monoculture on an industrial scale,
          particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia. Endangered species – most
          famously the Sumatran orangutan, but also rhinos, elephants, tigers,
          and numerous other fauna – have suffered from the unstoppable spread
          of oil palm plantations.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>D</strong>
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'Palm oil is surely one of the greatest threats to global
          biodiversity,' declares Dr Farnon Ellwood of the University of the
          West of England, Bristol. 'Palm oil is replacing rainforest, and
          rainforest is where all the species are. That's a problem.' This has
          led to some radical questions among environmentalists, such as whether
          consumers should try to boycott palm oil entirely.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Meanwhile Bhavani Shankar, Professor at London's School of Oriental
          and African Studies, argues, 'It's easy to say that palm oil is the
          enemy and we should be against it. It makes for a more dramatic story,
          and it's very intuitive. But given the complexity of the argument, I
          think a much more nuanced story is closer to the truth.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>E</strong>
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          One response to the boycott movement has been the argument for the
          vital role palm oil plays in lifting many millions of people in the
          developing world out of poverty. Is it desirable to have palm oil
          boycotted, replaced, eliminated from the global supply chain, given
          how many low-income people in developing countries depend on it for
          their livelihoods? How best to strike a utilitarian balance between
          these competing factors has become a serious bone of contention.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>F</strong>
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Even the deforestation argument isn't as straightforward as it seems.
          Oil palm plantations produce at least four and potentially up to ten
          times more oil per hectare than soybean, rapeseed, sunflower or other
          competing oils. That immensely high yield – which is predominantly
          what makes it so profitable – is potentially also an ecological
          benefit. If ten times more palm oil can be produced from a patch of
          land than any competing oil, then ten times more land would need to be
          cleared in order to produce the same volume of oil from that
          competitor.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          As for the question of carbon emissions, the issue really depends on
          what oil palm trees are replacing. Crops vary in the degree to which
          they sequester carbon – in other words, the amount of carbon they
          capture from the atmosphere and store within the plant. The more
          carbon a plant sequesters, the more it reduces the effect of climate
          change. As Shankar explains: '[Palm oil production] actually
          sequesters more carbon in some ways than other alternatives. […] Of
          course, if you're cutting down virgin forest it's terrible – that's
          what's happening in Indonesia and Malaysia, it's been allowed to get
          out of hand. But if it's replacing rice, for example, it might
          actually sequester more carbon.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>G</strong>
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The industry is now regulated by a group called the Roundtable on
          Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), consisting of palm growers, retailers,
          product manufacturers, and other interested parties. Over the past
          decade or so, an agreement has gradually been reached regarding
          standards that producers of palm oil have to meet in order for their
          product to be regarded as officially 'sustainable'. The RSPO insists
          upon no virgin forest clearing, transparency and regular assessment of
          carbon stocks, among other criteria. Only once these requirements are
          fully satisfied is the oil allowed to be sold as certified sustainable
          palm oil (CSPO). Recent figures show that the RSPO now certifies
          around 12 million tonnes of palm oil annually, equivalent to roughly
          21 percent of the world's total palm oil production.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>H</strong>
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There is even hope that oil palm plantations might not need to be such
          sterile monocultures, or 'green deserts', as Ellwood describes them.
          New research at Ellwood's lab hint at one plant which might make all
          the difference. The bird's nest fern (<em>Asplenium nidus</em>) grows
          on trees in an epiphytic fashion (meaning it's dependent on the tree
          only for support, not for nutrients), and is native to many tropical
          regions, where as a keystone species it performs a vital ecological
          role. Ellwood believes that reintroducing the bird's nest fern into
          oil palm plantations could potentially allow these areas to recover
          their biodiversity, providing a home for all manner of species, from
          fungi and bacteria, to invertebrates such as insects, amphibians,
          reptiles and even mammals.

          Building the Skyline: The Birth and Growth of Manhattan's Skyscrapers
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <em>
            Katharine L. Shester reviews a book by Jason Barr about the
            development of New York City
          </em>
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In <em>Building the Skyline</em>, Jason Barr takes the reader through
          a detailed history of New York City. The book combines geology,
          history, economics, and a lot of data to explain why business clusters
          developed where they did and how the early decisions of workers and
          firms shaped the skyline we see today. <em>Building the Skyline</em>{" "}
          is organized into two distinct parts. The first is primarily
          historical and addresses New York's settlement and growth from 1609 to
          1900; the second deals primarily with the 20th century and is a
          compilation of chapters commenting on different aspects of New York's
          urban development. The tone and organization of the book changes
          somewhat between the first and second parts, as the latter chapters
          incorporate aspects of Barr's related research papers.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Barr begins chapter one by taking the reader on a 'helicopter
          time-machine' ride – giving a fascinating account of how the New York
          landscape in 1609 might have looked from the sky. He then moves on to
          a subterranean walking tour of the city, indicating the location of
          rock and water below the subsoil, before taking the reader back to the
          surface. His love of the city comes through as he describes various
          fun facts about the location of the New York residence of early
          19th-century vice-president Aaron Burr as well as a number of legends
          about the city.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Chapters two and three take the reader up to the Civil War
          (1861-1865), with chapter two focusing on the early development of
          land and the implementation of a grid system in 1811. Chapter three
          focuses on land use before the Civil War. Both chapters are
          informative and well researched and set the stage for the economic
          analysis that comes later in the book. I would have liked Barr to
          expand upon his claim that existing tenements* prevented skyscrapers
          in certain neighborhoods because 'likely no skyscraper developer was
          interested in performing the necessary "slum clearance"'. Later in the
          book, Barr makes the claim that the depth of bedrock** was not a
          limiting factor for developers, as foundation costs were a small
          fraction of the cost of development. At first glance, it is not
          obvious why slum clearance would be limiting, while more expensive
          foundations would not.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Chapter four focuses on immigration and the location of neighborhoods
          and tenements in the late 19th century. Barr identifies four primary
          immigrant enclaves and analyses their locations in terms of the
          amenities available in the area. Most of these enclaves were located
          on the least valuable land, between the industries located on the
          waterfront and the wealthy neighborhoods bordering Central Park.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Part two of the book begins with a discussion of the economics of
          skyscraper height. In chapter five, Barr distinguishes between
          engineering height, economic height, and developer height – where
          engineering height is the tallest building that can be safely made at
          a given time, economic height is the height that is most efficient
          from society's point of view, and developer height is the actual
          height chosen by the developer, who is attempting to maximize return
          on investment.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Chapter five also has an interesting discussion of the technological
          advances that led to the construction of skyscrapers. For example, the
          introduction of iron and steel skeletal frames made thick,
          load-bearing walls unnecessary, expanding the usable square footage of
          buildings and increasing the use of windows and availability of
          natural light. Chapter six then presents data on building height
          throughout the 20th century and uses regression analysis to 'predict'
          building construction. While less technical than the research paper on
          which the chapter is based, it is probably more technical than would
          be preferred by a general audience.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Chapter seven tackles the 'bedrock myth', the assumption that the
          absence of bedrock close to the surface between Downtown and Midtown
          New York is the reason for skyscrapers not being built between the two
          urban centers. Rather, Barr argues that while deeper bedrock does
          increase foundation costs, these costs were neither prohibitively high
          nor were they large compared to the overall cost of building a
          skyscraper. What actually limited building heights in these areas was
          the fact that they were already filled with factories and tenements,
          which were not profitable to demolish. Barr then argues that the lack
          of bedrock is also the reason that skyscrapers were not built in these
          areas later, after the factories had relocated. Because the land was
          less valuable, it was not profitable to build skyscrapers, which would
          have been too expensive for the lower-value neighborhoods.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Chapter eight continues the discussion of the location of skyscrapers
          in New York, but focuses on the location of the skyscraper districts
          rather than on their absence in certain neighborhoods. Barr argues
          that while agglomeration was important, the fact that certain
          neighborhoods were already developed and filled with tenements limited
          the potential for skyscraper development in those areas. Existing
          high-value areas, however, were more likely to see skyscrapers because
          the cost of the land justified the cost of building higher.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Chapter nine focuses on the birth of skyscrapers in New York, and
          follows their development from the late 19th century through to 1915.
          Chapter ten looks at the economics of skyscraper height and uses the
          'construction cost function' to determine the marginal cost of
          building one floor higher. It finds that the marginal cost of adding
          floors increases only slightly with building height, allowing
          developers to add floors with relatively small cost increases. Barr
          uses this finding to refute the argument that skyscrapers are built
          taller than is economically efficient because of the desire to build
          the tallest building. He argues that, in fact, the cost of building
          taller is low, and the extra height can be justified in economic
          terms.
        </p>

          The final chapter of the book sums up the impacts of skyscrapers on
          New York City and highlights the contribution of the book to our
          understanding of the economics of skyscrapers. Barr argues that tall
          buildings are a reflection of urban vitality and that building height
          is not economically inefficient. He also notes that the role of
          government policy in limiting building height has been economically
          costly for Manhattan.
