        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">The secret of staying young</h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <em>Pheidole dentata</em>, a native ant of the south-eastern U.S.,
          isn't immortal. But scientists have found that it doesn't seem to show
          any signs of aging. Old workers ants can do everything just as well as
          the youngsters, and their brains appear just as sharp. 'We get a
          picture that these ants really don't decline,' says Ysabel Giraldo,
          who studies the ants for her doctoral thesis at Boston University.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Such age-defying feats are rare in the animal kingdom. Naked mole rats
          can live for almost 30 years and stay fit for nearly their entire
          lives. They can still reproduce even when old, and they never get
          cancer. But the vast majority of animals deteriorate with age just
          like people do. Like the naked mole rat, ants are social creatures
          that usually live in highly organised colonies. 'It's this social
          complexity that makes <em>P. dentata</em> useful for studying aging in
          people,' says Giraldo, now at the California Institute of Technology.
          Humans are also highly social, a trait that has been connected to
          healthier aging. By contrast, most animal studies of aging use mice,
          worms or fruit flies, which all lead much more isolated lives.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In the lab, <em>P. dentata</em> worker ants typically live for around
          140 days. Giraldo focused on ants at four age ranges: 20 to 22 days,
          45 to 47 days, 95 to 97 days and 120 to 122 days. Unlike all previous
          studies, which only estimated how old the ants were, her work tracked
          the ants from the time the pupae became adults, so she knew their
          exact ages. Then she put them through a range of tests.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Giraldo watched how well the ants took care of the young of the
          colony, recording how often each ant attended to, carried and fed
          them. She compared how well 20-day-old and 95-day-old ants followed
          the telltale scent that the insects usually leave to mark a trail to
          food. She tested how ants responded to light and also measured how
          active they were by counting how often ants in a small dish walked
          across a line. And she experimented with how ants react to live prey:
          a tethered fruit fly. Giraldo expected the older ants to perform
          poorly in all these tasks. But the elderly insects were all good
          caretakers and trail-followers – the 95-day-old ants could track the
          scent even longer than their younger counterparts. They all responded
          to light well, and the older ants were more active. And when it came
          to reacting to prey, the older ants attacked the poor fruit fly just
          as aggressively as the young ones did, flaring their mandibles or
          pulling at the fly's legs.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Then Giraldo compared the brains of 20-day-old and 95-day-old ants,
          identifying any cells that were close to death. She saw no major
          differences with age, nor was there any difference in the location of
          the dying cells, showing that age didn't seem to affect specific brain
          functions. Ants and other insects have structures in their brains
          called mushroom bodies, which are important for processing
          information, learning and memory. She also wanted to see if aging
          affects the density of synaptic complexes within these structures –
          regions where neurons come together. Again, the answer was no. What
          was more, the old ants didn't experience any drop in the levels of
          either serotonin or dopamine – brain chemicals whose decline often
          coincides with aging. In humans, for example, a decrease in serotonin
          has been linked to Alzheimer's disease.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'This is the first time anyone has looked at both behavioral and
          neural changes in these ants so thoroughly,' says Giraldo, who
          recently published the findings in the{" "}
          <em>Proceeding of the Royal Society B</em>. Scientists have looked at
          some similar aspects in bees, but the results of recent bee studies
          were mixed – some studies showed age-related declines, which
          biologists call senescence, and others didn't. 'For now, the study
          raises more questions than it answers,' Giraldo says, 'including how{" "}
          <em>P. dentata</em> stays in such good shape.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Also, if the ants don't deteriorate with age, why do they die at all?
          Out in the wild, the ants probably don't live for a full 140 days
          thanks to predators, disease and just being in an environment that's
          much harsher than the comforts of the lab. 'The lucky ants that do
          live into old age may suffer a steep decline just before dying,'
          Giraldo says, but she can't say for sure because her study wasn't
          designed to follow an ant's final moments.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'It will be important to extend these findings to other species of
          social insects,' says Gene E. Robinson, an entomologist at the
          University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This ant might be unique,
          or it might represent a broader pattern among other social bugs with
          possible clues to the science of aging in larger animals. Either way,
          it seems that for these ants, age really doesn't matter.

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 14-26</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Why zoos are good</h3>

        <p className="italic mb-4">
          Scientist David Hone makes the case for zoos
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In my view, it is perfectly possible for many species of animals
          living in zoos or wildlife parks to have a quality of life as high as,
          or higher than, in the wild. Animals in good zoos get a varied and
          high-quality diet with all the supplements required, and any illnesses
          they might have will be treated. Their movement might be somewhat
          restricted, but they have a safe environment in which to live, and
          they are spared bullying and social ostracism by others of their kind.
          They do not suffer from the threat or stress of predators, or the
          irritation and pain of parasites or injuries. The average captive
          animal will have a greater life expectancy compared with its wild
          counterpart, and will not die of drought, of starvation or in the jaws
          of a predator. A lot of very nasty things happen to truly 'wild'
          animals that simply don't happen in good zoos, and to view a life that
          is 'free' as one that is automatically 'good' is, I think, an error.
          Furthermore, zoos serve several key purposes.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Firstly, zoos aid conservation. Colossal numbers of species are
          becoming extinct across the world, and many more are increasingly
          threatened and therefore risk extinction. Moreover, some of these
          collapses have been sudden, dramatic and unexpected, or were simply
          discovered very late in the day. A species protected in captivity can
          be bred up to provide a reservoir population against a population
          crash or extinction in the wild. A good number of species only exist
          in captivity, with many of these living in zoos. Still more only exist
          in the wild because they have been reintroduced from zoos, or have
          wild populations that have been boosted by captive bred animals.
          Without these efforts there would be fewer species alive today.
          Although reintroduction successes are few and far between, the numbers
          are increasing, and the very fact that species have been saved or
          reintroduced as a result of captive breeding proves the value of such
          initiatives.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zoos also provide education. Many children and adults, especially
          those in cities, will never see a wild animal beyond a fox or pigeon.
          While it is true that television documentaries are becoming ever more
          detailed and impressive, and many natural history specimens are on
          display in museums, there really is nothing to compare with seeing a
          living creature in the flesh, hearing it, smelling it, watching what
          it does and having the time to absorb details. That alone will bring a
          greater understanding and perspective to many, and hopefully give them
          a greater appreciation for wildlife, conservation efforts and how they
          can contribute.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In addition to this, there is also the education that can take place
          in zoos through signs, talks and presentations which directly
          communicate information to visitors about the animals they are seeing
          and their place in the world. This was an area where zoos used to be
          lacking, but they are now increasingly sophisticated in their
          communication and outreach work. Many zoos also work directly to
          educate conservation workers in other countries, or send their animal
          keepers abroad to contribute their knowledge and skills to those
          working in zoos and reserves, thereby helping to improve conditions
          and reintroductions all over the world.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zoos also play a key role in research. If we are to save wild species
          and restore and repair ecosystems we need to know about how key
          species live, act and react. Being able to undertake research on
          animals in zoos where there is less risk and fewer variables means
          real changes can be effected on wild populations. Finding out about,
          for example, the oestrus cycle of an animal of its breeding rate helps
          us manage wild populations. Procedures such as capturing and moving
          at-risk or dangerous individuals are bolstered by knowledge gained in
          zoos about doses for anaesthetics, and by experience in handling and
          transporting animals. This can make a real difference to conservation
          efforts and to the reduction of human-animal conflicts, and can
          provide a knowledge base for helping with the increasing threats of
          habitat destruction and other problems.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In conclusion, considering the many ongoing global threats to the
          environment, it is hard for me to see zoos as anything other than
          essential to the long-term survival of numerous species. They are
          vital not just in terms of protecting animals, but as a means of
          learning about them to aid those still in the wild, as well as
          educating and informing the general population about these animals and
          their world so that they can assist or at least accept the need to be
          more environmentally conscious. Without them, the world would be, and
          would increasingly become, a much poorer place.

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Chelsea Rochman, an ecologist at the University of California, Davis,
          has been trying to answer a dismal question: Is everything terrible,
          or are things just very, very bad?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Rochman is a member of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and
          Synthesis's marine-debris working group, a collection of scientists
          who study, among other things, the growing problem of marine debris,
          also known as ocean trash. Plenty of studies have sounded alarm bells
          about the state of marine debris; in a recent paper published in the
          journal <em>Ecology</em>, Rochman and her colleagues set out to
          determine how many of those perceived risks are real.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Often, Rochman says, scientists will end a paper by speculating about
          the broader impacts of what they've found. For example, a study could
          show that certain seabirds eat plastic bags, and go on to warn that
          whole bird populations are at risk of dying out. 'But the truth was
          that nobody had yet tested those perceived threats,' Rochman says.
          'There wasn't a lot of information.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Rochman and her colleagues examined more than a hundred papers on the
          impacts of marine debris that were published through 2013. Within each
          paper, they asked what threats scientists had studied – 366 perceived
          threats in all – and what they'd actually found.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In 83 percent of cases, the perceived dangers of ocean trash were
          proven true. In the remaining cases, the working group found the
          studies had weaknesses in design and content which affected the
          validity of their conclusions – they lacked a control group, for
          example, or used faulty statistics.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Strikingly, Rochman says, only one well-designed study failed to find
          the effect it was looking for, an investigation of mussels ingesting
          microscopic bits. The plastic moved from the mussels' stomachs to
          their bloodstreams, scientists found, and stayed there for weeks – but
          didn't seem to stress out the shellfish.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          While mussels may be fine eating trash, though, the analysis also gave
          a clearer picture of the many ways that ocean debris <em>is</em>{" "}
          bothersome.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Within the studies they looked at, most of the proven threats came
          from plastic debris, rather than other materials like metal or wood.
          Most of the dangers also involved large pieces of debris – animals
          getting entangled in trash, for example, or eating it and severely
          injuring themselves.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But a lot of ocean debris is 'microplastic', or pieces smaller than
          five millimeters. These may be ingredients used in cosmetics and
          toiletries, fibers shed by synthetic clothing in the wash, or eroded
          remnants of larger debris. Compared to the number of studies
          investigating large-scale debris, Rochman's group found little
          research on the effects of these tiny bits. 'There are a lot of open
          questions still for microplastic,' Rochman says, though she notes that
          more papers on the subject have been published since 2013, the cutoff
          point for the group's analysis.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There are also, she adds, a lot of open questions about the ways that
          ocean debris can lead to sea-creature death. Many studies have looked
          at how plastic affects an individual animal, or that animal's tissues
          or cells, rather than whole populations. And in the lab, scientists
          often use higher concentrations of plastic than what's really in the
          ocean. None of that tells us how many birds or fish or sea turtles
          could die from plastic pollution – or how deaths in one species could
          affect that animal's predators, or the rest of the ecosystem.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'We need to be asking more ecologically relevant questions,' Rochman
          says. Usually, scientists don't know exactly how disasters such as a
          tanker accidentally spilling its whole cargo of oil and polluting huge
          areas of the ocean will affect the environment until after they've
          happened. 'We don't ask the right questions early enough,' she says.
          But if ecologists can understand how the slow-moving effect of ocean
          trash is damaging ecosystems, they might be able to prevent things
          from getting worse.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Asking the right questions can help policy makers, and the public,
          figure out where to focus their attention. The problems that look or
          sound most dramatic may not be the best places to start. For example,
          the name of the 'Great Pacific Garbage Patch' – a collection of marine
          debris in the northern Pacific Ocean – might conjure up a vast,
          floating trash island. In reality though, much of the debris is tiny
          or below the surface; a person could sail through the area without
          seeing any trash at all. A Dutch group called 'The Ocean Cleanup' is
          currently working on plans to put mechanical devices in the Pacific
          Garbage Patch and similar areas to suck up plastic. But a recent paper
          used simulations to show that strategically positioning the cleanup
          devices closer to shore would more effectively reduce pollution over
          the long term.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'I think clearing up some of these misperceptions is really
          important,' Rochman says. Among scientists as well as in the media,
          she says, 'A lot of the images about strandings and entanglement and
          all of that cause the perception that plastic debris is killing
          everything in the ocean.' Interrogating the existing scientific
          literature can help ecologists figure out which problems really need
          addressing, and which ones they'd be better off – like the mussels –
          absorbing and ignoring.
