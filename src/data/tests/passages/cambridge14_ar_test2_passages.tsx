        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Alexander Henderson (1831-1913)</h3>
        <p className="italic mb-4">
          Born in Scotland, Henderson emigrated to Canada in 1855 and become a
          well-known landscape photographer
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Alexander Henderson was born in Scotland in 1831 and was the son of a
          successful merchant. His grandfather, also called Alexander, had
          founded the family business, and later became the first chairman of
          the National Bank of Scotland. The family had extensive landholding in
          Scotland. Besides its residence in Edinburgh, it owned Press Estate,
          650 acres of farmland about 35 miles southeast of the city. The family
          often stayed at Press Castle, the large mansion on the northern edge
          of the property, and Alexander spent much of his childhood in the
          area, playing on the beach near Eyemouth or fishing in the streams
          nearby.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Even after he went to school at Murcheston Academy on the outskirts of
          Edinburgh, Henderson returned to Press at weekends. In 1849 he began a
          three-year apprenticeship to become an accountant. Although he never
          liked the prospect of a business career, he stayed with it to please
          his family. In October 1855, however, he emigrated to Canada with his
          wife Agnes Elder Robertson and they settled in Montreal.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Henderson learned photography in Montreal around the year 1857 and
          quickly took it up as a serious amateur. He became a personal friend
          and colleague of the Scottish – Canadian photographer William Notman.
          The two men made a photographic excursion to Niagara Falls in 1860 and
          they cooperated on experiments with magnesium flares as a source of
          artificial light in 1865. They belonged to the same societies and were
          among the founding members of the Art Association of Montreal.
          Henderson acted as chairman of the association's first meeting, which
          was held in Notman's studio on 11 January 1860.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In spite of their friendship, their styles of photography were quite
          different. While Notman's landscapes were noted for their bold
          realism, Henderson for the first 20 years of his career produced
          romantic images, showing the strong influence of the British landscape
          tradition. His artistic and technical progress was rapid and in 1865
          he published his first major collection of landscape photographs. The
          publication had limited circulation (only seven copies have ever been
          found), and was called <em>Canadian Views and Studies.</em> The
          contents of each copy vary significantly and have proved a useful
          source for evaluating Henderson's early work.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In 1866, he gave up his business to open a photographic studio,
          advertising himself as a portrait and landscape photographer. From
          about 1870 he dropped portraiture to specialize in landscape
          photography and other views. His numerous photographs of city life
          revealed in street scenes, houses, and markets are alive with human
          activity, and although his favourite subject was landscape he usually
          composed his scenes around such human pursuits as farming the land,
          cutting ice on a river, or sailing down a woodland stream. There was
          sufficient demand for these types of scenes and others he took
          depicting the lumber trade, steamboats and waterfalls to enable him to
          make a living. There was little competing hobby or amateur photography
          before the late 1880s because of the time-consuming techniques
          involved and the weight of equipment. People wanted to buy photographs
          as souvenirs of a trip or as gifts, and catering to this market,
          Henderson had stock photographs on display at his studio for mounting,
          framing, or inclusion in albums.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Henderson frequently exhibited his photographs in Montreal and abroad,
          in London, Edinburgh, Dublin, Paris, New York, and Philadelphia. He
          met with greater success in 1877 and 1878 in New York when he won
          first prizes in the exhibition held by E and H T Anthony and Company
          for landscapes using the Lambertype process. In 1878 his work won
          second prize at the world exhibition in Paris.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In the 1890s and 1880s Henderson travelled widely throughout Quebec
          and Ontario, in Canada, documenting the major cities of the two
          provinces and many of the villages in Quebec. He was especially fond
          of the wilderness and often travelled by canoe on the Blanche, du
          Lièvre, and other noted eastern rivers. He went on several occasions
          to the Maritimes and in 1872 he sailed by yacht along the lower north
          shore of the St Lawrence River. That same year, while in the lower St
          Lawrence River region, he took some photographs of the construction of
          the Intercolonial Railway. This undertaking led in 1875 to a
          commission from the railway to record the principal structures along
          the almost-completed line connecting Montreal to Halifax. Commissions
          from other railways followed. In 1876 he photographed bridges on the
          Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Occidental Railway between Montreal and
          Ottawa. In 1885 he went west along the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR)
          as far as Rogers Pass in British Columbia, where he took photographs
          of the mountains and the progress of construction.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In 1892 Henderson accepted a full-time position with the CPR as
          manager of a photographic department which he was to set up and
          administer. His duties included spending four months in the field each
          year. That summer he made his second trip west, photographing
          extensively along the railway line as far as Victoria. He continued in
          this post until 1897, when he retired completely from photography.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          When Henderson died in 1913, his huge collection of glass negatives
          was stored in the basement of his house. Today collections of his work
          are held at the National Archives of Canada, Ottawa, and the McCord
          Museum of Canadian History, Montreal.

          Back to the future of skyscraper design
        </h3>

        <p className="italic mb-4">
          Answers to the problem of excessive electricity use by skyscrapers and
          large public buildings can be found in ingenious but forgotten
          architectural designs of the 19th and early-20th centuries
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <em>The Recovery of Natural Environments in Architecture</em> by
          Professor Alan Short is the culmination of 30 years of research and
          award-winning green building design by Short and colleagues in
          Architecture, Engineering, Applied Maths and Earth Sciences at the
          University of Cambridge.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          'The crisis in building design is already here,' said Short. 'Policy
          makers think you can solve energy and building problems with gadgets.
          You can't. As global temperatures continue to rise, we are going to
          continue to squander more and more energy on keeping our buildings
          mechanically cool until we have run out of capacity.'
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Short is calling for a sweeping reinvention of how skyscrapers and
          major public buildings are designed – to end the reliance on sealed
          buildings which exist solely via the 'life support' system of vast air
          conditioning units.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Instead, he shows it is entirely possible to accommodate natural
          ventilation and cooling in large buildings by looking into the past,
          before the widespread introduction of air conditioning systems, which
          were 'relentlessly and aggressively marketed' by their inventors.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Short points out that to make most contemporary buildings habitable,
          they have to be sealed and air conditioned. The energy use and carbon
          emissions this generates is spectacular and largely unnecessary.
          Buildings in the West account for 40-50% of electricity usage,
          generating substantial carbon emissions, and the rest of the world is
          catching up at a frightening rate. Short regards glass, steel and
          air-conditioned skyscrapers as symbols of status, rather than
          practical ways of meeting our requirements.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Short's book highlights a developing and sophisticated art and science
          of ventilating buildings through the 19th and earlier-20th centuries,
          including the design of ingeniously ventilated hospitals. Of
          particular interest were those built to the designs of John Shaw
          Billings, including the first Johns Hopkins Hospital in the US city of
          Baltimore (1873-1889).
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          'We spent three years digitally modelling Billings' final designs,'
          says Short. 'We put pathogens* in the airstreams, modelled for someone
          with tuberculosis (TB) coughing in the wards and we found the
          ventilation systems in the room would have kept other patients safe
          from harm.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
          * pathogens: microorganisms that can cause disease
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          'We discovered that 19th-century hospital wards could generate up to
          24 air changes an hour – that's similar to the performance of a
          modern-day, computer-controlled operating theatre. We believe you
          could build wards based on these principles now.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Single rooms are not appropriate for all patients. Communal wards
          appropriate for certain patients – older people with dementia, for
          example – would work just as well in today's hospitals, at a fraction
          of the energy cost.'
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Professor Short contends the mindset and skill-sets behind these
          designs have been completely lost, lamenting the disappearance of
          expertly designed theatres, opera houses, and other buildings where up
          to half the volume of the building was given over to ensuring everyone
          got fresh air.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Much of the ingenuity present in 19th-century hospital and building
          design was driven by a panicked public clamouring for buildings that
          could protect against what was thought to be the lethal threat of
          miasmas – toxic air that spread disease. Miasmas were feared as the
          principal agents of disease and epidemics for centuries, and were used
          to explain the spread of infection from the Middle Ages right through
          to the cholera outbreaks in London and Paris during the 1850s. Foul
          air, rather than germs, was believed to be the main driver of
          'hospital fever', leading to disease and frequent death. The
          prosperous steered clear of hospitals.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While miasma theory has been long since disproved, Short has for the
          last 30 years advocated a return to some of the building design
          principles produced in its wake.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">G</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Today, huge amounts of a building's space and construction cost are
          given over to air conditioning. 'But I have designed and built a
          series of buildings over the past three decades which have tried to
          reinvent some of these ideas and then measure what happens.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          'To go forward into our new low-energy, low-carbon future, we would be
          well advised to look back at design before our high-energy,
          high-carbon present appeared. What is surprising is what a rich legacy
          we have abandoned.'
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">H</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Successful examples of Short's approach include the Queen's Building
          at De Montfort University in Leicester. Containing as many as 2,000
          staff and students, the entire building is naturally ventilated,
          passively cooled and naturally lit, including the two largest
          auditoria, each seating more than 150 people. The award-winning
          building uses a fraction of the electricity of comparable buildings in
          the UK.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Short contends that glass skyscrapers in London and around the world
          will become a liability over the next 20 or 30 years if climate
          modelling predictions and energy price rises come to pass as expected.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">I</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          He is convinced that sufficiently cooled skyscrapers using the natural
          environment can be produced in almost any climate. He and his team
          have worked on hybrid buildings in the harsh climates of Beijing and
          Chicago – built with natural ventilation assisted by back-up air
          conditioning – which, surprisingly perhaps, can be switched off more
          than half the time on milder days and during the spring and autumn.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Short looks at how we might reimagine the cities, offices and homes of
          the future. Maybe it's time we changed our outlook.

          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">
          Why companies should welcome disorder
        </h3>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Organisation is big business. Whether it is of our lives – all those
          inboxes and calendars – or how companies are structured, a
          multi-billion dollar industry helps to meet this need.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We have more strategies for time management, project management and
          self-organisation than at any other time in human history. We are told
          that we ought to organize our company, our home life, our week, our
          day and seven our sleep, all as a means to becoming more productive.
          Every week, countless seminars and workshops take place around the
          world to tell a paying public that they ought to structure their lives
          in order to achieve this.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This rhetoric has also crept into the thinking of business leaders and
          entrepreneurs, much to the delight of self-proclaimed perfectionists
          with the need to get everything right. The number of business schools
          and graduates has massively increased over the past 50 years,
          essentially teaching people how to organise well.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Ironically, however, the number of business that fail has also
          steadily increased. Work-related stress has increased. A large
          proportion of workers from all demographics claim to be dissatisfied
          with the way their work is structured and the way they are managed.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This begs the question: what has gone wrong? Why is it that on paper
          the drive for organisation seems a sure shot for increasing
          productivity, but in reality falls well short of what is expected?
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This has been a problem for a while now. Frederick Taylor was one of
          the forefathers of scientific management. Writing in the first half of
          the 20th century, he designed a number of principles to improve the
          efficiency of the work process, which have since become widespread in
          modern companies. So the approach has been around for a while.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          New research suggests that this obsession with efficiency is
          misguided. The problem is not necessarily the management theories or
          strategies we use to organise our work; it's the basic assumptions we
          hold in approaching how we work. Here it's the assumption that order
          is a necessary condition for productivity. This assumption has also
          fostered the idea that disorder must be detrimental to organizational
          productivity. The result is that businesses and people spend time and
          money organising themselves for the sake of organising, rather than
          actually looking at the end goal and usefulness of such an effort.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          What's more, recent studies show that order actually has diminishing
          returns. Order does increase productivity to a certain extent, but
          eventually the usefulness of the process of organisation, and the
          benefit it yields, reduce until the point where any further increase
          in order reduces productivity. Some argue that in a business, if the
          cost of formally structuring something outweighs the benefit of doing
          it, then that thing ought not to be formally structured. Instead, the
          resources involved can be better used elsewhere.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In fact, research shows that, when innovating, the best approach is to
          create an environment devoid of structure and hierarchy and enable
          everyone involved to engage as one organic group. These environments
          can lead to new solutions that, under conventionally structured
          environments (filled with bottlenecks in term of information flow,
          power structures, rules, and routines) would never be reached.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">G</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In recent times companies have slowly started to embrace this
          disorganisation. Many of them embrace it in terms of perception
          (embracing the idea of disorder, as opposed to fearing it) and in
          terms of process (putting mechanisms in place to reduce structure).
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          For example, Oticon, a large Danish manufacturer of hearing aids, used
          what it called a 'spaghetti' structure in order to reduce the
          organisation's rigid hierarchies. This involved scrapping formal job
          titles and giving staff huge amounts of ownership over their own time
          and projects. This approach proved to be highly successful initially,
          with clear improvements in worker productivity in all facets of the
          business.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In similar fashion, the former chairman of General Electric embraced
          disorganisation, putting forward the idea of the 'boundaryless'
          organisation. Again, it involves breaking down the barriers between
          different parts of a company and encouraging virtual collaboration and
          flexible working. Google and a number of other tech companies have
          embraced (at least in part) these kinds of flexible structures,
          facilitated by technology and strong company values which glue people
          together.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">H</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A word of warning to others thinking of jumping on this bandwagon: the
          evidence so far suggests disorder, much like order, also seems to have
          diminishing utility, and can also have detrimental effects on
