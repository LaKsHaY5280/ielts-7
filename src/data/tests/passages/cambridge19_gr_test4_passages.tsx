            <li>
              ride more than two bicycles side by side. When riding side by

            <li>
              ride within 2 metres behind a moving motor vehicle for more than
              200 metres
            </li>
            <li>lead an animal from your bicycle.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 className="font-bold mb-1">Bicycles must be equipped with:</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1 mb-4">

            <li>a bell or similar warning device in working order.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-2">
            When riding at night or in weather with reduced visibility, your
            bicycle must show:

          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
            <li>
              a white light at the front that can be seen for at least 200
              metres
            </li>
            <li>
              a red light at the rear that can be seen for at least 200 metres
            </li>
            <li>
              a red reflector at the rear that can be seen for at least 50

            Reflective clothing for night cycling
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            There are no laws specifying what clothes you have to wear when
            cycling but it is strongly recommended that, at night or when
            visibility is poor, you wear a reflective vest or jacket or,
            alternatively, clothing with reflective strips. You can obtain these
            items from cycle shops, outdoor clothing shops and sports stores.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-bold mb-1">Riding with children</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When cycling with your family, make sure you are all visible –
            especially your children. Maximise visibility by attaching reflector
            strips to the back and front of the bike, helmet, arms, legs and
            shoes. Children twelve years and over have to follow the same road
            rules as adults.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-bold mb-1">Cycling offences</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If you break cycling rules you will be fined. For instance, the fine
            for not wearing a helmet correctly fixed is $100. When senior police
            officers are asked to name the most foolish cycling behaviour, they
            all agree that cycling without a helmet causes the most serious
            injuries.

            Campus Health Orientations and Health Insurance at Graybridge
            University
          </h3>

            Campus Health orientations for international students
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            International students registered in courses at the university need
            to attend a Campus Health orientation session. During the
            orientation session, students will learn about the range of services
            we provide at Campus Health, how to access these services and how to
            access health care in Australia more generally. It is important that
            international students have information about the local health
            system; for example, many students may be unaware that Australian
            universities do not have doctors on campus.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-bold mb-1">Health insurance</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            According to the rules of the university, all international students
            are required to have health insurance for the entire period of their
            studies. The university has an agreement with International Care
            Cover, which specialises in health insurance plans for international
            students in Australia. During the orientation, therefore, students
            will also learn how to use their International Care Cover policy to
            cover medical expenses during their study period.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-bold mb-1">Graybridge international students</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Prior to arrival at Graybridge, the International Care Cover policy
            will have been arranged for each student and the cost added to their
            university fees. If students arrive outside office hours, they
            should report to the International Student Centre (ISC) on the next
            business day. The ISC will guide students through the procedures
            for:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
            <li>registering for classes at the university</li>
            <li>
              providing proof of living arrangements (e.g., with a relative or
              friend, or at a student residence)
            </li>
            <li>
              supplying emergency contacts (these should be either a parent, a
              local relative, or friend)
            </li>
            <li>
              verifying the start date of their International Care Cover policy
            </li>
            <li>
              locating their International Care Cover number, which is required
              when requesting a medical appointment.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 className="font-bold mb-1">Making appointments</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Appointments for medical services need to be made either by phone or
            in person at the Campus Health reception. Online bookings for
            services cannot be made at Campus Health as each student's
            eligibility for services needs to be verified.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Students should not wait until they are sick to contact Campus
            Health. Even if students are unsure which service to request, the
            reception staff can advise them.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When making an appointment, students must bring their student card
            and International Care Cover number. Most appointments are available
            free of charge for international students covered by International
            Care Cover. Health service fees for appointments with a specialist
            are payable by the student at the time of the appointment and can
            then be reimbursed by International Care Cover.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Students should arrive promptly for their appointments. If they must
            cancel, students should give staff 24 hours' notice. If they fail to
            attend an appointment, the administration reserves the right to bill
            them for the cancelled appointment.

            Designing a Training Programme
          </h3>

          <p className="mb-4">
            As a trainer or training manager in a business organisation, you may
            need to design training programmes for new or existing employees.
            Here are some guidelines to help you in this task.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-bold mb-1">
            Step 1: Identify the aims of the training
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Start by identifying what you expect the employees to be able to do
            when they have completed the training programme. For this, it is
            important to meet and speak to the individual or team who requested
            the training. For example, if you are designing a programme that
            instructs staff on how to use a company induction manual, it is
            important to learn who the induction manual is written for and in
            what context it is going to be used. Talk to those who made the
            request and try to anticipate issues that might arise. This can save
            time and resources. Discuss details such as what the employees are
            doing now and what they should be able to do after the training.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-bold mb-1">Step 2: Map out the stages</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When writing down the stages of your programme, start by outlining
            the main aims and then break these down into smaller steps. For
            example, if the aim is to teach staff how to organise a meeting from
            start to finish, you might include steps like: 'prepare an agenda,
            book a venue, ensure the right people attend'. When deciding the
            order of the steps, it can be useful to arrange the programme
            chronologically, starting with what needs to be done first.
            Alternatively, you can structure the programme around competence
            levels (from simple to complex actions), to build the confidence of
            the training participants.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-bold mb-1">Step 3: Get feedback</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Consulting as many people as possible before delivering the
            programme can prevent expensive errors. You can discuss the content
            with experts on the subject, with future participants, or with
            potential users such as a participant's manager.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-bold mb-1">
            Step 4: Choose appropriate training methods
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The most effective way to structure the programme is to combine
            various types of activities, including, for example, mini-lectures
            or handouts, followed by discussions and exercises that allow
            participants to relate the information to their own experience.
            Participants benefit not only from the trainer's expertise, but also
            from the shared knowledge and experience of other participants.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            For a programme to be useful to participants, however, it must
            relate to the real world. Thus, role-plays, simulations, and team
            activities should be based on realistic working environments.
            Trainers can ask participants to bring examples of relevant
            documents or issues from their own workplace, which can serve as
            examples for practical activities.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Finally, you need to write down the final programme. Include a
            breakdown of teaching points, how they will be explored (e.g.,
            through group work, presentation, simulation, etc.) and how much
            time each will take. Set out a timetable, noting activities,
            discussions and other items. Remember, however, that programmes
            should be flexible. Not all programmes run at the same pace; some
            groups may take longer to cover certain material, while others may
            already be familiar with some of the content.

            Communicating Climate Change
          </h3>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>A</strong> Scientists and governments have been slow to
            respond to the large-scale environmental threats facing the world
            today – in particular global climate change. It has taken decades
            for governments to accept that climate change is happening, largely
            because vested interests with huge financial resources have been
            effective in swaying public opinion. In contrast, a very active
            environmental campaigning movement has emerged since the middle of
            the twentieth century. This has raised awareness and gradually
            gained increasing influence on key decision-makers.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>B</strong> From the 1990s onwards, however, the campaigns
            and media messages coming from the environmental movement have
            increasingly been criticised for their overly negative tone and for
            creating 'climate fatigue'. By constantly focusing on large-scale
            disasters and extreme weather, but offering no realistic strategies
            beyond urgent demands for governments to ban fossil fuels,
            environmental campaigns have been accused of failing to engage the
            public, and even of alienating those who might otherwise be
            supporters. As a result, there have been widespread calls for more
            emotionally balanced messaging and, in particular, for offering

            <strong>C</strong> Early writers on environmental communication,
            such as Peter Sandman, suggested that where there was urgent need
            for action, the most effective strategy for engaging the public was
            to make them feel 'appropriately scared'. But research has since
            shown that too much fear can create a defensive emotional reaction
            in people, which can result in their feeling helpless or ignoring or
            denying the risk. More recently, environmental campaigners have
            argued that making people feel guilty or fearful can demoralise
            them, and that it would be better to find more 'emotionally
            balanced' ways of engaging with them. In particular, they propose a
            greater emphasis on solutions and the potential for positive change,
            drawing on more recent research, which indicates that seeing
            practical solutions lessens negative feelings about environmental
            problems.

            <strong>D</strong> Recently, a number of environmental organisations
            have revised their communications strategies to incorporate these
            ideas. For example, in the UK, a group called the Climate Coalition
            has emphasised the positive things people care about that could be
            affected by climate change. And in the US, the Environmental Defence
            Fund has started setting out solutions to climate change, rather
            than simply saying what the problem is. Meanwhile, in many countries
            there has been a growth in local environmental groups engaged in
            activities such as community gardens for food growing, or care and
            protection of natural environments. These focus on practical
            activities that can benefit both the environment and the communities
            concerned. Engaging with these groups can connect people to nature
            in their own local area.

            <strong>E</strong> On the other hand, George Marshall from the
            Climate Outreach and Information Network has criticised what he sees
            as the overemphasis by environmental organisations on presenting
            rational arguments, believing this to be motivated by a false
            assumption that people are rational. Certainly, it is clear that
            attitudes towards environmental issues are affected by people's
            cultural values and beliefs: someone with a strongly individualistic
            worldview, for example, may be less receptive to messages about the
            importance of regulating business. In some parts of the world,
            climate change is seen as a political rather than a scientific
            issue. Different views on this issue can also lead to people
            ignoring or dismissing scientific information, or rejecting policies
            because they are seen to represent the views of opposing political
            perspectives. Because of this, environmental campaigners
            increasingly recognise the need to listen to and use the language of
            those whose minds they are trying to change.

            <strong>F</strong> However, Pat Dade, of the cultural values mapping
            company Cultural Dynamics, believes many environmental campaigns and
            messages are still based on guilt. One of the main problems with
            guilt as an emotion is that creating it depends on a moralising
            approach – implying that some actions are right while others are
            wrong. And people who are told they are doing something 'wrong' tend
            to feel judged and criticised, and to respond defensively. This is
            why a more positive approach is often most effective. People in
            general have a range of psychological needs, such as feeling that
            they can decide their own destiny, that there is meaning in what
            they do, and that they are connected to others. Where environmental
            campaigners can show that protecting the environment also offers a
            way of meeting those needs, it is likely that more people will
            respond positively.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>G</strong> So, what kind of approach would the evidence
            suggest is likely to be most successful? A group of UK
            government-funded researchers has proposed a set of principles for
            effective environmental communication. It advises environmental
            campaigners to understand what matters to their audiences, and to
            show how environmental protection can deliver those things for them.
            It encourages communicators to make sure they live by the advice
            they give to others, but at the same time to avoid creating a new
            moral code that judges those who do not conform. It also stresses
            that environmental campaigns need to show that they understand the
            pressures that modern living places on people, and to use language
            and ideas that reflect shared values (for example, the concept of
            'wastefulness').

            <strong>H</strong> Above all, this approach suggests that people
            need both information and empowerment: they need to have their
            intelligence treated with respect but also to be given realistic
            strategies through which they can implement change. No wonder fear
            and guilt are counterproductive. The important principle is creating
            confidence that the environmental challenges facing the world can be
            addressed. Fear can create a sense of urgency, but effective
            communication about environmental threats such as climate change
            needs to be coupled with confidence that there are things that can
            be done, individually and collectively, to avert potential disaster.
