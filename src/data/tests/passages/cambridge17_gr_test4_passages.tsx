        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A Perry Forest</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Our walks cater for all ages and all degrees of fitness, and are
          suitable for children as well as adults. Every Saturday and Sunday
          throughout the year our experts lead several walks. So whether you
          want a short stroll on level ground, or a more challenging walk to the
          top of Shepherds Hill, we have something for you.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B Pugsley Beach Nature Reserve</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The reserve has plenty of wildlife, whatever the time of year, with
          its numerous species of birds, and plants that grow hardly anywhere
          else, but the autumn is when hundreds of grey seals arrive on the
          beach to have their young. The covered viewing area offers spectacular
          close-up views of all this, and hot drinks and snacks are available to
          help you keep warm.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C Marston Hall</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          If you ever wonder what wildlife trusts do for the environment, come
          to Marston Hall, where our rangers will show you how they manage
          wildlife habitats, from providing feeding boxes for squirrels to
          creating ponds for frogs and many other creatures. They'll also take
          you on a short walk through the ancient pine forest in search of
          animal tracks and signs.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D Craven Discovery Centre</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Here at the discovery centre, youngsters are introduced to the animals
          in our petting zoo, where they can stroke or feed the sheep, rabbits,
          ponies and other residents. Then they're taken on a walk through the
          wood. Meanwhile, the adults can take part in one of our woodland
          activities, such as learning basic woodworking skills.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Go birdwatching or catch insects as daylight fades, then have a gentle
          jog along the River Wale by moonlight, and end by toasting
          marshmallows on a campfire. It's all part of a Family Wild Outing in
          Shelford, organised by the local wildlife trust. Ideal for both adults
          and children.

          Hinchingbrooke School Sixth Form
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Hinchingbrooke School consists of the lower school, for students aged
          11 to 16, and the sixth form, for ages 16 to 18+. In the sixth form we
          provide a strong programme of guidance for students, whether they are
          planning on going to university, into training or straight into the
          workplace. We have a high rate of success with applications to
          universities, including growing success in recent years for medical
          school applicants.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          While the majority of sixth-form students enter from the lower school,
          recent significant expansion of the sixth form is largely the result
          of an increase in applicants from other schools in the area. We pride
          ourselves on giving these external students a particularly warm
          welcome. We welcome your interest in joining our sixth form and look
          forward to offering you a place if you satisfy our minimum entry
          requirements.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          If you are an internal student, please apply through the MyChoice16
          application system. This is also where external students need to view
          course information. If you are an external student whose current
          school does not use MyChoice16 for online applications, please see our
          website for an application form to the school. We hold an annual Open
          Evening in the autumn term when you can come and view our facilities
          and ask any questions you may have.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Care, guidance and support in the sixth form at Hinchingbrooke is
          something of which we are very proud, and each of our students is
          treated as an individual. You will be assigned a professional
          sixth-form tutor who will provide you with support and guidance, and
          will be responsible for helping you make sensible choices about your
          future career path.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          You will meet with your tutor at a fixed time every fortnight to
          discuss progress and any concerns you or your subject teachers may
          have about your effort and achievement. You will also set targets for
          yourself, in agreement with your tutor and subject teachers, and your
          progress towards achieving these targets will be monitored in your
          tutor meetings.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Tree cutters at work</h3>
        <p className="italic mb-4">
          Tree surgeon Ivars Balodis describes the teamwork involved in cutting
          down a large tree
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Today the tree-cutting team consists of myself, Gary and Mikael. We're
          going to cut down a tall tree that is inside the boundary of a busy
          timber yard. It's Saturday — not a working day for the yard — and it
          is far easier to remove a tree when no-one else is around. As
          supervisor, I first pop into our office to sort out the paperwork for
          the day, which includes the risk assessments. Then I look at the most
          up-to-date weather forecast as wind and rain make our job much more
          difficult. Luckily, we've picked a good day.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Next, we load up the equipment — things like petrol-driven chainsaws
          of varying sizes, helmets and waterproofs, spades, rakes and other
          tools, etc. must all go on the truck before the three of us set off.
          On arrival at the site, we have a quick discussion on the procedure
          for the day. After that, one of us — today it's Gary — goes up the
          tree to quickly select his anchor point. This is the position from
          which he'll cut down the tree. It must be high enough to enable access
          throughout the tree's branches, but also have sufficient strength to
          support the climber. The first few big branches can be cut from the
          tree in large pieces and dropped into the yard, so we make good
          progress during the morning and start our wood pile there.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Having removed the more accessible branches, we have lunch and then
          set up a simple system to reach the smaller upper branches. This
          involves placing a pulley in the tree and using thick rope to drag the
          branches down. When they're cut, these will fall further away —
          outside the boundary of the yard. On the other side of the perimeter
          fence is a wide grass verge and then a footpath, where I set up a
          number of signs to alert the public to our activities. Working
          alongside a road requires vigilance, so I monitor the movements of
          pedestrians, and as Gary starts work, I watch what he's doing, so I
          can ensure safety. Once the branches are on the ground, I throw them
          back over the fence to Mikael, who cuts them up and feeds the machine
          that dices them into very small pieces called wood chippings.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Plumbing skills</h3>
        <p className="italic mb-4">
          Plumbers install and repair the equipment and pipes needed to carry
          water, gas and waste in homes and other buildings.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          In a residential building, such as a block of flats, underfloor jobs
          that involve plumbing, mechanical and electrical systems are common.
          They may need to take place in a narrow space that is often only about
          35 centimetres deep. In addition, the floors are typically covered
          with a wood product, engineered to resemble solid wood, that has very
          strict criteria as far as drilling and cutting are concerned. The
          plumber cannot just go in and cut holes and lay pipes. He must first
          think about what he is doing, read and understand the cutting chart
          that accompanies each of his tools and visualise how his work will
          impact on other tradespeople, before proceeding.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Commercial plumbers working on office buildings, hotels, restaurants,
          etc. have the same issues and co-ordination problems as residential
          plumbers, but often have to install equipment that is more
          sophisticated. This is because it forms part of integrated systems
          where mechanical work and plumbing work are combined. The equipment
          will have specific installation instructions, so it is critical that
          the plumber has the cognitive ability to understand these. In
          addition, often the structures are complex, and the floors and walls
          must be X-rayed prior to drilling in order to avoid hitting key
          elements such as reinforcing steel.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Service plumbers go in where others have been and often face
          situations where they must troubleshoot various possible causes of a
          plumbing problem. In order to do this effectively, they must have
          complete knowledge of, say, a customer's shower unit they are
          servicing, even if they did not install it! They must have the ability
          to translate the symptoms they can see, such as leaks and blockages,
          into the actual problem and then take the appropriate action to
          rectify the issue in a fast and cost-effective way. Often service
          plumbers encounter residential or commercial customers who are either
          facing great inconvenience or have had their operations severely
          disrupted because of a plumbing issue. Successful service plumbers not
          only need good mechanical skills, but they typically need very good
          people skills to provide the necessary support.

          Why it is important to save species like the dormouse
        </h3>
        <p className="italic mb-4">
          A scheme to save the dormouse, a tiny woodland mammal, from extinction
          could lead to the reintroduction of larger lost species such as the
          wolf and sea eagle to the UK
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          More than 100 years after they were last recorded by naturalists in
          the Wensleydale valley in northern England rare dormice have returned
          to a secret woodland location there. Twenty breeding pairs of rare
          hazel dormice were recently reintroduced as part of a national scheme
          to reverse the decline of one of Britain's most threatened mammals.
          This reintroduction led by the People's Trust for Endangered Species
          (PTES) and supported by a coalition of conservation groups is the 22nd
          in the last 23 years. Dormice depend on well managed woodlands and
          healthy connected hedgerows for their survival. But changes in land
          use since the 1940s have been so dramatic that the dormice that remain
          have limited living space and are increasingly isolated.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Ahead of the release the PTES found a site of dense good quality
          woodland while the captive bred dormice waited in quarantine. After
          examination by vets the dormice were placed in their soft release
          accommodation in pairs. This consisted of secure wooden boxes fitted
          to trees and surrounded by a meter square cage. For 10 days the
          dormice were checked and given food daily then a small opening was
          made allowing them the freedom to explore while retaining the security
          of the cage. Everything was removed in October when the animals
          started preparing to go into hibernation for the winter.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          'The hope is that we have a free-living population in the wood but we
          won't know how they have fared until next year' said Ian White of the
          PTES. Unsuitable habitat, captive bred animals and incorrect
          management could all ruin the chances of success of such schemes.
          However a distinctive factor of this release White explained is the
          intention of linking up with another released dormouse population 3
          miles away by managing the land between. The goal is to create a wider
          landscape for dormice and that will make the population more robust.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Woodlands were traditionally managed through regularly cutting back
          certain trees to ground level to stimulate growth and provide firewood
          or timber for local residents. This system was known as coppicing, and
          as an added bonus it happened to provide varied food and plenty of
          light for dormice. But the practice has been largely lost with much
          remaining woodland sliced up by roads railways and fields. England
          also had more than 50% of its hedgerows dug up between 1946 and 1993
          as small fields were combined to make larger ones and farmland was
          sold for building projects. All this has had an adverse effect on
          dormouse populations.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          'It's very important that we reintroduce the dormouse because they are
          a good species to get people involved with conservation,' said White.
          'They are a fascinating species that is rare but you can still see.
          They promote good woodland management and what's good for dormice is
          good for a large range of species.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Helen Meech the director of Rewilding Britain, an organisation
          campaigning to restore lost species and habitats to the British
          countryside said that such reintroductions would increase people's
          familiarity with living with more wild animals once again. People's
          everyday wildlife experience is becoming limited to seeing grey
          squirrels and pigeons she explained. 'We are increasingly disconnected
          from nature. In 30 to 40 years' time, we might get to the point where
          we can start to think about bringing back wolves, bison or moose but
          let's start with species that will have a lighter impact for now.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Over centuries, Britain has lost many key species that are critical
          for healthy ecosystems. Here are some of the species conservationists
          have reintroduced or are proposing to reintroduce.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The lynx is believed to have disappeared from Britain about 1000 year
          ago. Experts say it would help control the fast-growing population of
          red deer allowing forests to regenerate and support greater
          biodiversity. The preference of the lynx a shy animal to stay in its
          woodland habitat would make a threat to livestock of humans unlikely.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          After an absence of 400 years beavers are back in Britain. The Devon
          Beaver project cites improvements in biodiversity and water after the
          reintroduction of a pair near Okehampton in 2011. Scotland's first
          reintroduction in Knapdale forest in 2009 was hailed an outstanding
          success but an unlicensed free-living population in the river Tay has
          caused problems.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Lost to Britain in the 1700s the wolf is the most controversial
          species proposed for reintroduction given its potential to kill
          agricultural livestock. But they are critical to the restoration of
          ecosystems that have been overgrazed by deer. Despite their fearsome
          reputation they present a low risk to people. Because of the space a
          wolf population would need the Scottish Highlands would be an obvious
          place for their reintroduction and could generate millions of pounds
          in tourism.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The sea eagle also known as the white-tailed eagle was driven to
          extinction in Britain earlier this century. A reintroduction programme
          has seen it return to the Inner Hebrides island of Mull. Proposals to
          bring it back to the east of England failed following concerns from
          landowners about the threat to livestock. Successful schemes in Europe
          have offered compensation for this.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Then there is the wild boar which disappeared in the 13th century
          because of hunting. They increase biodiversity and create space for
          trees and plants to grow but can cause damage to crops and gardens.
          The species has been quietly re-establishing itself in the woodlands
          of Britain for several decades.
