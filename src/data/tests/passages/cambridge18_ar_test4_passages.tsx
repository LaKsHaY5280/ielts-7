          Rooftops covered with grass, vegetable gardens and lush foliage are
          now a common sight in many cities around the world. More and more
          private companies and city authorities are investing in green roofs,
          drawn to their wide-ranging benefits. Among the benefits are saving on
          energy costs, mitigating the risk of floods, making habitats for urban
          wildlife, tackling air pollution and even growing food. These
          increasingly radical urban designs can help cities adapt to the
          monumental problems they face, such as access to resources and a lack
          of green space due to development. But the involvement of city
          authorities, businesses and other institutions is crucial to ensuring
          their success – as is research investigating different options to suit
          the variety of rooftop spaces found in cities. The UK is relatively
          new to developing green roofs, and local governments and institutions
          are playing a major role in spreading the practice. London is home to
          much of the UK's green roof market, mainly due to forward-thinking
          policies such as the London Plan, which has paved the way to more than
          doubling the area of green roofs in the capital.

          Ongoing research is showcasing how green roofs in cities can integrate
          with 'living walls': environmentally friendly walls which are
          partially or completely covered with greenery, including a growing
          medium, such as soil or water. Research also indicates that green
          roofs can be integrated with drainage systems on the ground, such as
          street trees, so that the water is managed better and the built
          environment is made more sustainable. There is also evidence to
          demonstrate the social value of green roofs. Doctors are increasingly
          prescribing time spent gardening outdoors for patients dealing with
          anxiety and depression. And research has found that access to even the
          most basic green spaces can provide a better quality of life for
          dementia sufferers and help people avoid obesity.

          In North America, green roofs have become mainstream, with a wide
          array of expansive, accessible and food-producing roofs installed in
          buildings. Again, city leaders and authorities have helped push the
          movement forward – only recently, San Francisco, USA, created a policy
          requiring new buildings to have green roofs. Toronto, Canada, has
          policies dating from the 1990s, encouraging the development of urban
          farms on rooftops. These countries also benefit from having newer
          buildings than in many parts of the world, which makes it easier to
          install green roofs. Being able to keep enough water at roof height
          and distribute it right across the rooftop is crucial to maintaining
          the plants on any green roof – especially on 'edible roofs' where
          fruit and vegetables are farmed. And it's much easier to do this in
          newer buildings, which can typically hold greater weight, than to
          retro-fit old ones. Having a stronger roof also makes it easier to
          grow a greater variety of plants, since the soil can be deeper.

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          For green roofs to become the norm for new developments, there needs
          to be support from public authorities and private investors. Those
          responsible for maintaining buildings may have to acquire new skills,
          such as landscaping, and in some cases, volunteers may be needed to
          help out. Other considerations include installing drainage paths,
          meeting health and safety requirements and perhaps allowing access for
          the public, as well as planning restrictions and disruption from
          regular activities in and around the buildings during installation. To
          convince investors and developers that installing green roofs is
          worthwhile, economic arguments are still the most important. The term
          'natural capital' has been developed to explain the economic value of
          nature; for example, measuring the money saved by installing natural
          solutions to protect against flood damage, adapt to climate change or
          help people lead healthier and happier lives.

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          As the expertise about green roofs grows, official standards have been
          developed to ensure that they are designed, constructed and maintained
          properly, and function well. Improvements in the science and
          technology underpinning green roof development have also led to new
          variations in the concept. For example, 'blue roofs' enable buildings
          to hold water over longer periods of time, rather than draining it
          away quickly – crucial in times of heavier rainfall. There are also
          combinations of green roofs with solar panels, and 'brown roofs' which
          are wilder in nature and maximise biodiversity. If the trend
          continues, it could create new jobs and a more vibrant and sustainable
          local food economy – alongside many other benefits. There are still
          barriers to overcome, but the evidence so far indicates that green
          roofs have the potential to transform cities and help them function
          sustainably long into the future. The success stories need to be
          studied and replicated elsewhere, to make green, blue, brown and
          food-producing roofs the norm in cities around the world.

          on Reading Passage 2 below.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4">The growth mindset</h3>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Over the past century, a powerful idea has taken root in the
          educational landscape. The concept of intelligence as something innate
          has been supplanted by the idea that intelligence is not fixed, and
          that, with the right training, we can be the authors of our own
          cognitive capabilities. Psychologist Alfred Binet, the developer of
          the first intelligence tests, was one of many 19th-century scientists
          who held that earlier view and sought to quantify cognitive ability.
          Then, in the early 20th century, progressive thinkers revolted against
          the notion that inherent ability is destiny. Instead, educators such
          as John Dewey argued that every child's intelligence could be
          developed, given the right environment.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          'Growth mindset theory' is a relatively new – and extremely popular –
          version of this idea. In many schools today you will see hallways
          covered in motivational posters and hear speeches on the mindset of
          great sporting heroes who simply <em>believed</em> their way to the
          top. A major focus of the growth mindset in schools is coaxing
          students away from seeing failure as an indication of their ability,
          and towards seeing it as a chance to improve that ability. As
          educationalist Jeff Howard noted several decades ago: 'Smart is not
          something that you just are, smart is something that you can get.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The idea of the growth mindset is based on the work of psychologist
          Carol Dweck in California in the 1990s. In one key experiment, Dweck
          divided a group of 10- to 12-year-olds into two groups. All were told
          that they had achieved a high score on a test but the first group were
          praised for their intelligence in achieving this, while the others
          were praised for their effort. The second group – those who had been
          instilled with a 'growth mindset' – were subsequently far more likely
          to put effort into future tasks. Meanwhile, the former took on only
          those tasks that would not risk their sense of worth. This group had
          inferred that success or failure is due to innate ability, and this
          'fixed mindset' had led them to fear of failure and lack of effort.
          Praising ability actually made the students perform worse, while
          praising effort emphasised that change was possible.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          One of the greatest impediments to successfully implementing a growth
          mindset, however, is the education system itself: in many parts of the
          world, the school climate is obsessed with performance in the form of
          constant testing, analysing and ranking of students – a key
          characteristic of the fixed mindset. Nor is it unusual for schools to
          create a certain cognitive dissonance, when they applaud the benefits
          of a growth mindset but then hand out fixed target grades in lessons
          based on performance.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Aside from the implementation problem, the original growth mindset
          research has also received harsh criticism. The statistician Andrew
          Gelman claims that 'their research designs have enough degrees of
          freedom that they could take their data to support just about any
          theory at all'. Professor of Psychology Timothy Bates, who has been
          trying to replicate Dweck's work, is finding that the results are
          repeatedly null. He notes that: 'People with a growth mindset don't
          cope any better with failure … Kids with the growth mindset aren't
          getting better grades, either before or after our intervention study.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Much of this criticism is not lost on Dweck, and she deserves great
          credit for responding to it and adapting her work accordingly. In
          fact, she argues that her work has been misunderstood and misapplied
          in a range of ways. She has also expressed concerns that her theories
          are being misappropriated in schools by being conflated with the
          self-esteem movement: 'For me the growth mindset is a tool for
          learning and improvement. It's not just a vehicle for making children
          feel good.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          But there is another factor at work here. The failure to translate the
          growth mindset into the classroom might reflect a misunderstanding of
          the nature of teaching and learning itself. Growth mindset supporters
          David Yeager and Gregory Walton claim that interventions should be
          delivered in a subtle way to maximise their effectiveness. They say
          that if adolescents perceive a teacher's intervention as conveying
          that they are in need of help, this could undo its intended effects.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          A lot of what drives students is their innate beliefs and how they
          perceive themselves. There is a strong correlation between
          self-perception and achievement, but there is evidence to suggest that
          the actual effect of achievement on self-perception is stronger than
          the other way round. To stand up in a classroom and successfully
          deliver a good speech is a genuine achievement, and that is likely to
          be more powerfully motivating than vague notions of 'motivation'
          itself.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Recent evidence would suggest that growth mindset interventions are
          not the elixir of student learning that its proponents claim it to be.
          The growth mindset appears to be a viable construct in the lab, which,
          when administered in the classroom via targeted interventions, doesn't
          seem to work. It is hard to dispute that having faith in the capacity
          to change is a good attribute for students. Paradoxically, however,
          that aspiration is not well served by direct interventions that try to
          instil it.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Motivational posters and talks are often a waste of time, and might
          well give students a deluded notion of what success actually means.
          Teaching concrete skills such as how to write an effective
          introduction to an essay then praising students' effort in getting
          there is probably a far better way of improving confidence than
          telling them how unique they are, or indeed how capable they are of
          changing their own brains. Perhaps growth mindset works best as a
          philosophy and not an intervention.

          Alfred Wegener: science, exploration and the theory of continental
          drift
        </h3>
        <p className="italic mb-4">by Mott T Greene</p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">Introduction</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          This is a book about the life and scientific work of Alfred Wegener,
          whose reputation today rests with his theory of continental
          displacements, better known as 'continental drift'. Wegener proposed
          this theory in 1912 and developed it extensively for nearly 20 years.
          His book on the subject, <em>The Origin of Continents</em> and{" "}
          <em>Oceans</em>, went through four editions and was the focus of an
          international controversy in his lifetime and for some years after his
          death.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Wegener's basic idea was that many mysteries about the Earth's history
          could be solved if one supposed that the continents moved laterally,
          rather than supposing that they remained fixed in place. Wegener
          showed in great detail how such continental movements were plausible
          and how they worked, using evidence from a large number of sciences
          including geology, geophysics, paleontology, and climatology.
          Wegener's idea – that the continents move – is at the heart of the
          theory that guides Earth sciences today: namely plate tectonics. Plate
          tectonics is in many respects quite different from Wegener's proposal,
          in the same way that modern evolutionary theory is very different from
          the ideas Charles Darwin proposed in the 1850s about biological
          evolution. Yet plate tectonics is a descendant of Alfred Wegener's
          theory of continental drift, in quite the same way that modern
          evolutionary theory is a descendant of Darwin's theory of natural
          selection.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          When I started writing about Wegener's life and work, one of the most
          intriguing things about him for me was that, although he came up with
          a theory on continental drift, he was not a geologist. He trained as
          an astronomer and pursued a career in atmospheric physics. When he
          proposed the theory of continental displacements in 1912, he was a
          lecturer in physics and astronomy at the University of Marburg, in
          southern Germany. However, he was not an 'unknown'. In 1906 he had set
          a world record (with his brother Kurt) for time aloft in a hot-air
          balloon: 52 hours. Between 1906 and 1908 he had taken part in a highly
          publicized and extremely dangerous expedition to the coast of
          northeast Greenland. He had also made a name for himself amongst a
          small circle of meteorologists and atmospheric physicists in Germany
          as the author of a textbook, <em>Thermodynamics of the Atmosphere</em>{" "}
          (1911), and of a number of interesting scientific papers.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          As important as Wegener's work on continental drift has turned out to
          be, it was largely a sideline to his interest in atmospheric physics,
          geophysics, and paleoclimatology*, and thus I have been at great pains
          to put Wegener's work on continental drift in the larger context of
          his other scientific work, and in the even larger context of
          atmospheric sciences in his lifetime. This is a 'continental drift
          book' only to the extent that Wegener was interested in that topic and
          later became famous for it. My treatment of his other scientific work
          is no less detailed, though I certainly have devoted more attention to
          the reception of his ideas on continental displacement, as they were
          much more controversial than his other work.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Readers interested in the specific detail of Wegener's career will see
          that he often stopped pursuing a given line of investigation
          (sometimes for years on end), only to pick it up later. I have tried
          to provide guideposts to his rapidly shifting interests by
          characterizing different phases of his life as careers in different
          sciences, which is reflected in the titles of the chapters. Thus, the
          index should be a sufficient guide for those interested in a
          particular aspect of Wegener's life but perhaps not all of it. My own
          feeling, however, is that the parts do not make as much sense on their
          own as do all of his activities taken together. In this respect I urge
          readers to try to experience Wegener's life as he lived it, with all
          the interruptions, changes of mind, and renewed efforts this entailed.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Wegener left behind a few published works but, as was standard
          practice, these reported the results of his work – not the journey he
          took to reach that point. Only a few hundred of the many thousands of
          letters he wrote and received in his lifetime have survived and he
          didn't keep notebooks or diaries that recorded his life and
          activities. He was not active (with a few exceptions) in scientific
          societies, and did not seek to find influence or advance his ideas
          through professional contacts and politics, spending most of his time
          at home in his study reading and writing, or in the field collecting
          observations.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Some famous scientists, such as Newton, Darwin, and Einstein, left
          mountains of written material behind, hundreds of notebooks and
          letters numbering in the tens of thousands. Others, like Michael
          Faraday, left extensive journals of their thoughts and speculations,
          parallel to their scientific notebooks. The more such material a
          scientist leaves behind, the better chance a biographer has of forming
          an accurate picture of how a scientist's ideas took shape and evolved.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          I am firmly of the opinion that most of us, Wegener included, are not
          in any real sense the authors of our own lives. We plan, think, and
          act, often with apparent freedom, but most of the time our lives
          'happen to us', and we only retrospectively turn this happenstance
          into a coherent narrative of fulfilled intentions. This book,
          therefore, is a story both of the life and scientific work that Alfred
          Wegener planned and intended and of the life and scientific work that
          actually 'happened to him'. These are, as I think you will soon see,
          not always the same thing.
