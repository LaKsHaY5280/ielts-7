        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">THE IMPORTANCE OF CHILDREN'S PLAY</h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Brick by brick, six-year-old Alice is building a magical kingdom.
          Imagining fairy-tale turrets and fire-breathing dragons, wicked
          witches and gallant heroes, she's creating an enchanting world.
          Although she isn't aware of it, this fantasy is helping her take her
          first steps towards her capacity for creativity and so it will have
          important repercussions in her adult life.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Minutes later, Alice has abandoned the kingdom in favour of playing
          schools with her younger brother. When she bosses him around as his
          'teacher', she's practising how to regulate her emotions through
          pretence. Later on, when they tire of this and settle down with a
          board game, she's learning about the need to follow rules and take
          turns with a partner.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'Play in all its rich variety is one of the highest achievements of
          the human species,' says Dr David Whitebread from the Faculty of
          Education at the University of Cambridge, UK. 'It underpins how we
          develop as intellectual, problem-solving adults and is crucial to our
          success as a highly adaptable species.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Recognizing the importance of play is not new: over two millennia ago,
          the Greek philosopher Plato extolled its virtues as a means of
          developing skills for adult life, and ideas about play-based learning
          have been developing since the 19th century.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But we live in changing times, and Whitebread is mindful of a
          worldwide decline in play, pointing out that over half the people in
          the world now live in cities. 'The opportunities for free play, which
          I experienced almost every day of my childhood, are becoming
          increasingly scarce,' he says. Outdoor play is curtailed by
          perceptions of risk to do with traffic, as well as parents' increased
          wish to protect their children from being the victims of crime, and by
          the emphasis on 'earlier is better' which is leading to greater
          competition in academic learning and schools.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          International bodies like the United Nations and the European Union
          have begun to develop policies concerned with children's right to
          play, and to consider implications for leisure facilities and
          educational programmes. But what they often lack is the evidence to
          base policies on.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'The type of play we are interested in is child-initiated, spontaneous
          and unpredictable – but, as soon as you ask a five-year-old "to play",
          then you as the researcher have intervened,' explains Dr Sara Baker.
          'And we want to know what the long-term impact of play is. It's a real
          challenge.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Dr Jenny Gibson agrees, pointing out that although some of the steps
          in the puzzle of how and why play is important have been looked at,
          there is very little data on the impact it has on the child's later
          life.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Now, thanks to the university's new Centre for Research on Play in
          Education, Development and Learning (PEDAL), Whitebread, Baker, Gibson
          and a team of researchers hope to provide evidence on the role played
          by play in how a child develops.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'A strong possibility is that play supports the early development of
          children's self-control,' explains Baker. 'This is our ability to
          develop awareness of our own thinking progresses – it influences how
          effectively we go about undertaking challenging activities.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In a study carried out by Baker with toddlers and young pre-schoolers,
          she found that children with greater self-control solved problems more
          quickly when exploring an unfamiliar set-up requiring scientific
          reasoning. 'This sort of evidence makes up think that giving children
          the chance to play will make them more successful problem-solvers in
          the long run.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          If playful experiences do facilitate this aspect of development, say
          the researchers, it could be extremely significant for educational
          practices, because the ability to self-regulate has been shown to be a
          key predictor of academic performance.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Gibson adds: 'Playful behavior is also an important indicator of
          healthy social and emotional development. In my previous research, I
          investigated how observing children at play can give us important
          clues about their well-being and can even be useful in the diagnosis
          of neurodevelopmental disorders like autism.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Whitebread's recent research has involved developing a play-based
          approach to supporting children's writing. 'Many primary school
          children find writing difficult, but we showed in a previous study
          that a playful stimulus was far more effective than an instructional
          one.' Children wrote longer and better-structured stories when they
          first played with dolls representing characters in the story. In the
          latest study, children first created their story with Lego*, with
          similar results. 'Many teachers commented that they had always
          previously had children saying they didn't know what to write about.
          With the Lego building, however, not a single child said this through
          the whole year of the project.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Whitebread, who directs PEDAL, trained as a primary school teacher in
          the early 1970s, when, as he describes, 'the teaching of young
          children was largely a quiet backwater, untroubled by any serious
          intellectual debate or controversy.' Now, the landscape is very
          different, with hotly debated topics such as school starting age.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'Somehow the importance of play has been lost in recent decades. It's
          regarded as something trivial, or even as something negative that
          contrasts with "work". Let's not lose sight of its benefits, and the
          fundamental contributions it makes to human achievements in the arts,
          sciences and technology. Let's make sure children have a rich diet of
          play experiences.'

          The growth of bike-sharing schemes around the world
        </h3>

        <p className="italic mb-4">
          How Dutch engineer Luud Schimmelpennink helped to devise urban
          bike-sharing schemes
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The original idea for an urban bike-sharing scheme dates back to a
          summer's day in Amsterdam in 1965. Provo, the organization that came
          up with the idea, was a group of Dutch activists who wanted to change
          society. They believed the scheme, which was known as the Witte
          Fietsenplan, was an answer to the perceived threats of air pollution
          and consumerism. In the centre of Amsterdam, they painted a small
          number of used bikes white. They also distributed leaflets describing
          the dangers of cars and inviting people to use the white bikes. The
          bikes were then left unlocked at various locations around the city, to
          be used by anyone in need of transport.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Luud Schimmelpennink, a Dutch industrial engineer who still lives and
          cycles in Amsterdam, was heavily involved in the original scheme. He
          recalls how the scheme succeeded in attracting a great deal of
          attention – particularly when it came to publicising Provo's aims –
          but struggled to get off the ground. The police were opposed to
          Provo's initiatives and almost as soon as the white bikes were
          distributed around the city, they removed them. However, for
          Schimmelpennink and for bike-sharing schemes in general, this was just
          the beginning. 'The first Witte Fietsenplan was just a symbolic
          thing,' he says. 'We painted a few bikes white, that was all. Things
          got more serious when I became a member of the Amsterdam city council
          two years later.'
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Schimmelpennink seized this opportunity to present a more elaborate
          Witte Fietsenplan to the city council. 'My idea was that the
          municipality of Amsterdam would distribute 10,000 white bikes over the
          city, for everyone to use,' he explains. 'I made serious calculations.
          It turned out that a white bicycle – per person, per kilometer – would
          cost the municipality only 10% of what it contributed to public
          transport per person per kilometer.' Nevertheless, the council
          unanimously rejected the plan. 'They said that the bicycle belongs to
          the past. They saw a glorious future for the car,' says
          Schimmelpennink. But he was not in the least discouraged.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Schimmelpennink never stopped believing in bike-sharing, and in the
          mid-90s, two Danes asked for his help to set up a system in
          Copenhagen. The result was the world's first large-scale bike-share
          programme. It worked on a deposit: 'You dropped a coin in the bike and
          when you returned it, you got your money back.' After setting up the
          Danish system, Schimmelpennink decided to try his luck again in the
          Netherlands – and this time he succeeded in arousing the interest of
          the Dutch Ministry of Transport. 'Times had changed,' he recalls.
          'People had become more environmentally conscious, and the Danish
          experiment had proved that bike-sharing was a real possibility.' A new
          Witte Fietsenplan was launched in 1999 in Amsterdam. However, riding a
          white bike was no longer free; it cost one guilder per trip and
          payment was made with a chip card developed by the Dutch bank
          Postbank. Schimmelpennink designed conspicuous, sturdy white bikes
          locked in special racks which could be opened with the chip card – the
          plan started with 250 bikes, distributed over five stations.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Theo Molenaar, who was a system designer for the project, worked
          alongside Schimmelpennink. 'I remember when we were testing the bike
          racks, he announced that he had already designed better ones. But of
          course, we had to go through with the ones we had.' The system,
          however, was prone to vandalism and theft. 'After every weekend there
          would always be a couple of bikes missing,' Molenaar says. 'I really
          have no idea what people did with them, because they could instantly
          be recognised as white bikes.' But the biggest blow came when Postbank
          decided to abolish the chip card, because it wasn't profitable. 'That
          chip card was pivotal to the system,' Molenaar says. 'To continue the
          project we would have needed to set up another system, but the
          business partner had lost interest.'
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Schimmelpennink was disappointed, but – characteristically – not for
          long. In 2002 he got a call from the French advertising corporation JC
          Decaux, who wanted to set up his bike-sharing scheme in Vienna. 'That
          went really well. After Vienna, they set up a system in Lyon. Then in
          2007, Paris followed. That was a decisive moment in the history of
          bike-sharing.' The huge and unexpected success of the Parisian
          bike-sharing programme, which now boasts more than 20,000 bicycles,
          inspired cities all over the world to set up their own schemes, all
          modelled on Schimmelpennink's. 'It's wonderful that this happened,' he
          says. 'But financially I didn't really benefit from it, because I
          never filed for a patent.'
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">G</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In Amsterdam today, 38% of all trips are made by bike and, along with
          Copenhagen, it is regarded as one of the two most cycle-friendly
          capitals in the world – but the city never got another Witte
          Fietsenplan. Molenaar believes this may be because everybody in
          Amsterdam already has a bike. Schimmelpennink, however, cannot see
          that this changes Amsterdam's need for a bike-sharing scheme. 'People
          who travel on the underground don't carry their bikes around. But
          often they need additional transport to reach their final
          destination.' Although he thinks it is strange that a city like
          Amsterdam does not have a successful bike-sharing scheme, he is
          optimistic about the future. 'In the '60s we didn't stand a chance
          because people were prepared to give their lives to keep cars in the
          city. But that mentality has totally changed. Today everybody longs
          for cities that are not dominated by cars.'

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">
          Motivational factors and the hospitality industry
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          A critical ingredient in the success of hotels is developing and
          maintaining superior performance from their employees. How is that
          accomplished? What Human Resource Management (HRM) practices should
          organizations invest in to acquire and retain great employees?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Some hotels aim to provide superior working conditions for their
          employees. The idea originated from workplaces – usually in the
          non-service sector – that emphasized fun and enjoyment as part of
          work-life balance. By contrast, the service sector, and more
          specifically hotels, has traditionally not extended these practices to
          address basic employee needs, such as good working conditions.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Pfeffer (1994) emphasizes that in order to succeed in a global
          business environment, organizations must make investment in Human
          Resource Management (HRM) to allow them to acquire employees who
          possess better skills and capabilities than their competitors. This
          investment will be to their competitive advantage. Despite this
          recognition of the importance of employee development, the hospitality
          industry has historically been dominated by underdeveloped HR
          practices (Lucas, 2002).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Lucas also points out that 'the substance of HRM practices does not
          appear to be designed to foster constructive relations with employees
          or to represent a managerial approach that enables developing and
          drawing out the full potential of people, even though employees may be
          broadly satisfied with many aspects of their work' (Lucas, 2002). In
          addition, or maybe as a result, high employee turnover has been a
          recurring problem throughout the hospitality industry. Among the many
          cited reasons are low compensation, inadequate benefits, poor working
          conditions and compromised employee morale and attitudes (Maroudas et
          al., 2008).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Ng and Sorensen (2008) demonstrated that when managers provide
          recognition to employees, motivate employees to work together, and
          remove obstacles preventing effective performance, employees feel more
          obligated to stay with the company. This was succinctly summarized by
          Michel et al. (2013): '[P]roviding support to employees gives them the
          confidence to perform their jobs better and the motivation to stay
          with the organization.' Hospitality organizations can therefore
          enhance employee motivation and retention through the development and
          improvement of their working conditions. These conditions are
          inherently linked to the working environment.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          While it seems likely that employees' reactions to their job
          characteristics could be affected by a predisposition to view their
          work environment negatively, no evidence exists to support this
          hypothesis (Spector et al., 2000). However, given the opportunity,
          many people will find something to complain about in relation to their
          workplace (Poulston, 2009). There is a strong link between the
          perceptions of employees and particular factors of their work
          environment that are separate from the work itself, including company
          policies, salary and vacations.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Such conditions are particularly troubling for the luxury hotel
          market, where high-quality service, requiring a sophisticated approach
          to HRM, is recognized as a critical source of competitive advantage
          (Maroudas et al., 2008). In a real sense, the services of hotel
          employees represent their industry (Schneider and Bowen, 1993). This
          representation has commonly been limited to guest experiences. This
          suggests that there has been a dichotomy between the guest environment
          provided in luxury hotels and the working conditions of their
          employees.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          It is therefore essential for hotel management to develop HRM
          practices that enable them to inspire and retain competent employees.
          This requires an understanding of what motivates employees at
          different levels of management and different stages of their careers
          (Enz and Siguaw, 2000). This implies that it is beneficial for hotel
          managers to understand what practices are most favorable to increase
          employee satisfaction and retention.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Herzberg (1966) proposes that people have two major types of needs,
          the first being extrinsic motivation factors relating to the context
          in which work is performed, rather than the work itself. These include
          working conditions and job security. When these factors are
          unfavorable, job dissatisfaction may result. Significantly, though,
          just fulfilling these needs does not result in satisfaction, but only
          in the reduction of dissatisfaction (Maroudas et al., 2008).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Employees also have intrinsic motivation needs or motivators, which
          include such factors as achievement and recognition. Unlike extrinsic
          factors, motivator factors may ideally result in job satisfaction
          (Maroudas et al., 2008). Herzberg's (1966) theory discusses the need
          for a 'balance' of these two types of needs.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The impact of fun as a motivating factor at work has also been
          explored. For example, Tews, Michel and Stafford (2013) conducted a
          study focusing on staff from a chain of themed restaurants in the
          United States. It was found that fun activities had a favorable impact
          on performance and manager support for fun had a favorable impact in
          reducing turnover. Their findings support the view that fun may indeed
          have a beneficial effect, but the framing of that fun must be
          carefully aligned with both organizational goals and employee
          characteristics. 'Managers must learn how to achieve the delicate
          balance of allowing employees the freedom to enjoy themselves at work
          while simultaneously high levels of performance' (Tews et al., 2013).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Deery (2008) has recommended several actions that can be adopted at
          the organizational level to retain good staff as well as assist in
          balancing work and family life. Those particularly appropriate to the
