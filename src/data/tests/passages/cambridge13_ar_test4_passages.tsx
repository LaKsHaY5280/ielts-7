          Cutty Sark: the fastest sailing ship of all time
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The nineteenth century was a period of great technological development
          in Britain, and for shipping the major changes were from wind to steam
          power, and from wood to iron and steel.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The fastest commercial sailing vessels of all time were clippers,
          three-masted ships built to transport goods around the world, although
          some also took passengers. From the 1840s until 1869, when the Suez
          Canal opened and steam propulsion was replacing sail, clippers
          dominated world trade. Although many were built, only one has survived
          more or less intact: <em>Cutty Sark</em>, now on display in Greenwich,
          southeast London.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <em>Cutty Sark</em>'s unusual name comes from the poem{" "}
          <em>Tam O'Shanter</em> by the Scottish poet Robert Burns. Tam, a
          farmer, is chased by a witch called Nannie, who is wearing a '
          <em>cutty sark</em>' – an old Scottish name for a short nightdress.
          The witch is depicted in <em>Cutty Sark</em>'s figurehead – the
          carving of a woman typically at the front of old sailing ships. In
          legend, and in Burns's poem, witches cannot cross water, so this was a
          rather strange choice of name for a ship.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <em>Cutty Sark</em> was built in Dumbarton, Scotland, in 1869, for a
          shipping company owned by John Willis. To carry out construction,
          Willis chose a new shipbuilding firm, Scott & Linton, and ensured that
          the contract with them put him in a very strong position. In the end,
          the firm was forced out of business, and the ship was finished by a
          competitor.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Willis's company was active in the tea trade between China and
          Britain, where speed could bring shipowners both profits and prestige,
          so <em>Cutty Sark</em> was designed to make the journey more quickly
          than any other ship. On her maiden voyage, in 1870, she set sail from
          London, carrying large amounts of goods to China. She returned laden
          with tea, making the journey back to London in four months. However,{" "}
          <em>Cutty Sark</em> never lived up to the high expectations of her
          owner, as a result of bad winds and various misfortunes. On one
          occasion, in 1872, the ship and a rival clipper, <em>Thermopylae</em>,
          left port in China on the same day. Crossing the Indian Ocean,{" "}
          <em>Cutty Sark</em> gained a lead of over 400 miles, but then her
          rudder was severely damaged in stormy seas, making her impossible to
          steer. The ship's crew had the daunting task of repairing the rudder
          at sea, and only succeeded at the second attempt. <em>Cutty Sark</em>{" "}
          reached London a week after <em>Thermopylae.</em>
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Steam ships posed a growing threat to clippers, as their speed and
          cargo capacity increased. In addition, the opening of the Suez Canal
          in 1869, the same year that <em>Cutty Sark</em> was launched, had a
          serious impact. While steam ships could make use of the quick, direct
          route between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, the canal was of no
          use to sailing ships, which needed the much stronger winds of the
          oceans, and so had to sail a far greater distance. Steam ships reduced
          the journey time between Britain and China by approximately two
          months.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          By 1878, tea traders weren't interested in <em>Cutty Sark</em>, and
          instead, she took on the much less prestigious work of carrying any
          cargo between any two ports in the world. In 1880, violence aboard the
          ship led ultimately to the replacement of the captain with an
          incompetent drunkard who stole the crew's wages. He was suspended from
          service, and a new captain appointed. This marked a turnaround and the
          beginning of the most successful period in <em>Cutty Sark</em>'s
          working life, transporting wool from Australia to Britain. One such
          journey took just under 12 weeks, beating every other ship sailing
          that year by around a month.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The ship's next captain, Richard Woodget, was an excellent navigator,
          who got the best out of both his ship and his crew. As a sailing ship,{" "}
          <em>Cutty Sark</em> depended on the strong trade winds of the southern
          hemisphere, and Woodget took her further south than any previous
          captain, bringing her dangerously close to icebergs off the southern
          tip of South America. His gamble paid off, though, and the ship was
          the fastest vessel in the wool trade for ten years.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          As competition from steam ships increased in the 1890s, and{" "}
          <em>Cutty Sark</em> approached the end of her life expectancy, she
          became less profitable. She was sold to a Portuguese firm, which
          renamed her <em>Ferreira.</em> For the next 25 years, she again
          carried miscellaneous cargoes around the world.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Badly damaged in a gale in 1922, she was put into Falmouth harbor in
          southwest England, for repairs. Wilfred Dowman, a retired sea captain
          who owned a training vessel, recognised her and tried to buy her, but
          without success. She returned to Portugal and was sold to another
          Portuguese company. Dowman was determined, however, and offered a high
          price: this was accepted, and the ship returned to Falmouth the
          following year and had her original name restored.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Dowman used <em>Cutty Sark</em> as a training ship, and she continued
          in this role after his death. When she was no longer required, in
          1954, she was transferred to dry dock at Greenwich to go on public
          display. The ship suffered from fire in 2007, and again, less
          seriously, in 2014, but now <em>Cutty Sark</em> attracts a quarter of
          a million visitors a year.

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 14-26</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">SAVING THE SOIL</h3>

        <p className="italic mb-4">
          More than a third of the Earth's top layer is at risk. Is there hope
          for our planet's most precious resource?
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          More than a third of the world's soil is endangered, according to a
          recent UN report. If we don't slow the decline, all farmable soil
          could be gone in 60 years. Since soil grows 95% of our food, and
          sustains human life in other more surprising ways, that is a huge
          problem.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Peter Groffman, from the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in New
          York, points out that soil scientists have been warning about the
          degradation of the world's soil for decades. At the same time, our
          understanding of its importance to humans has grown. A single gram of
          healthy soil might contain 100 million bacteria, as well as other
          microorganisms such as viruses and fungi, living amid decomposing
          plants and various minerals.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          That means soils do not just grow our food, but are the source of
          nearly all our existing antibiotics, and could be our best hope in the
          fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Soil is also an ally
          against climate change: as microorganisms within soil digest dead
          animals and plants, they lock in their carbon content, holding three
          times the amount of carbon as does the entire atmosphere. Soils also
          store water, preventing flood damage: in the UK, damage to buildings,
          roads and bridges from floods caused by soil degradation costs £233
          million every year.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If the soil loses its ability to perform these functions, the human
          race could be in big trouble. The danger is not that the soil will
          disappear completely, but that the microorganisms that give it its
          special properties will be lost. And once this has happened, it may
          take the soil thousands of years to recover.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Agriculture is by far the biggest problem. In the wild, when plants
          grow they remove nutrients from the soil, but then when the plants die
          and decay these nutrients are returned directly to the soil. Humans
          tend not to return unused parts of harvested crops directly to the
          soil to enrich it, meaning that the soil gradually becomes less
          fertile. In the past we developed strategies to get around the
          problem, such as regularly varying the types of crops grown, or
          leaving fields uncultivated for a season.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          But these practices became inconvenient as populations grew and
          agriculture had to be run on more commercial lines. A solution came in
          the early 20<sup>th</sup> century with the Haber-Bosch process for
          manufacturing ammonium nitrate. Farmers have been putting this
          synthetic fertiliser on their fields ever since.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          But over the past few decades, it has become clear this wasn't such a
          bright idea. Chemical fertilisers can release polluting nitrous oxide
          into the atmosphere and excess is often washed away with the rain,
          releasing nitrogen into rivers. More recently, we have found that
          indiscriminate use of fertilisers hurts the soil itself, turning it
          acidic and salty, and degrading the soil they are supposed to nourish.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          One of the people looking for a solution to his problem is Pius
          Floris, who started out running a tree-care business in the
          Netherlands, and now advises some of the world's top soil scientists.
          He came to realise that the best way to ensure his trees flourished
          was to take care of the soil, and has developed a cocktail of
          beneficial bacteria, fungi and humus* to do this. Researchers at the
          University of Valladolid in Spain recently used this cocktail on soils
          destroyed by years of fertiliser overuse. When they applied Floris's
          mix to the desert-like test plots, a good crop of plants emerged that
          were not just healthy at the surface, but had roots strong enough to
          pierce dirt as hard as rock. The few plants that grew in the control
          plots, fed with traditional fertilisers, were small and weak
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          However, measures like this are not enough to solve the global soil
          degradation problem. To assess our options on a global scale we first
          need an accurate picture of what types of soil are out there, and the
          problems they face. That's not easy. For one thing, there is no agreed
          international system for classifying soil. In an attempt to unify the
          different approaches, the UN has created the Global Soil Map project.
          Researchers from nine countries are working together to create a map
          linked to a database that can be fed measurements from field surveys,
          drone surveys, satellite imagery, lad analyses and so on to provide
          real-time data on the state of the soil. Within the next four years,
          they aim to have mapped soils worldwide to a depth of 100 metres, with
          the results freely accessible to all.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">G</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          But this is only a first step. We need ways of presenting the problem
          that bring it home to governments and the wider public, says Pamela
          Chasek at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, in
          Winnipeg, Canada. 'Most scientists don't speak language that
          policy-makers can understand, and vice versa.' Chasek and her
          colleagues have proposed a goal of 'zero net land degradation'. Like
          the idea of carbon neutrality, it is an easily understood target that
          can help shape expectations and encourage action.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          For soils on the brink, that may be too late. Several researchers are
          agitating for the immediate creation of protected zones for endangered
          soils. One difficulty here is defining what these areas should
          conserve: areas where the greatest soil diversity is present? Or areas
          of unspoilt soils that could act as a future benchmark of quality?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Whatever we do, if we want our soils to survive, we need to take
          action now.

          The Happiness Industry: How the Government and Big Business Sold Us
          Well-Being
        </p>
        <p className="italic mb-4">By William Davies</p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'Happiness is the ultimate goal because it is self-evidently good. If
          we are asked why happiness matters we can give no further external
          reason. It just obviously does matter.' This pronouncement by Richard
          Layard, an economist and advocate of 'positive psychology', summarises
          the beliefs of many people today. For Layard and others like him, it
          is obvious that the purpose of government is to promote a state of
          collective well-being. The only question is how to achieve it, and
          here positive psychology – a supposed science that not only identifies
          what makes people happy but also allows their happiness to be measured
          – can show the way. Equipped with this science, they say, governments
          can secure happiness in society in a way they never could in the past.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          It is an astonishingly crude and simple-minded way of thinking, and
          for that very reason increasingly popular. Those who think in this way
          are oblivious to the vast philosophical literature in which the
          meaning and value of happiness have been explored and questioned, and
          write as if nothing of any importance had been thought on the subject
          until it came to their attention. It was the philosopher Jeremy
          Bentham (1748-1832) who was more than anyone else responsible for the
          development of this way of thinking. For Bentham it was obvious that
          the human good consists of pleasure and the absence of pain. The Greek
          philosopher Aristotle may have identified happiness with
          self-realisation in the 4th century BC, and thinkers throughout the
          ages may have struggled to reconcile the pursuit of happiness with
          other human values, but for Bentham all this was mere metaphysics or
          fiction. Without knowing anything much of him or the school of moral
          theory he established – since they are by education and intellectual
          conviction illiterate in the history of ideas – our advocates of
          positive psychology follow in his tracks in rejecting as outmoded and
          irrelevant pretty much the entirety of ethical reflection on human
          happiness to date.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But as William Davies notes in his recent book{" "}
          <em>The Happiness Industry</em>, the view that happiness is the only
          self-evident good is actually a way of limiting moral inquiry. One of
          the virtues of this rich, lucid and arresting book is that it places
          the current cult of happiness in a well-defined historical framework.
          Rightly, Davies his story with Bentham, noting that he was far more
          than a philosopher. Davies writes, 'Bentham's activities were those
          which we might now associate with a public sector management
          consultant'. In the 1790s, he wrote to the Home Office suggesting that
          the departments of government be linked together through a set of
          'conversation tubes', and to the Bank of England with a design for a
          printing device that could produce unforgeable banknotes. He drew up
          plans for a 'frigidarium' to keep provisions such as meat, fish, fruit
          and vegetables fresh. His celebrated design for a prison to be known
          as a 'Panopticon', in which prisoners would be kept in solitary
          confinement while being visible at all times to the guards, was very
          nearly adopted. (Surprisingly, Davies does not discuss the fact that
          Bentham meant his Panopticon not just as a model prison but also as an
          instrument of control that could be applied to schools and factories.)
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Bentham was also a pioneer of the 'science of happiness'. If happiness
          is to be regarded as a science, it has to be measured, and Bentham
          suggested two ways in which this might be done. Viewing happiness as a
          complex of pleasurable sensations, he suggested that it might be
          quantified by measuring the human pulse rate. Alternatively, money
          could be used as the standard for quantification: if two different
          goods have the same price, it can be claimed that they produce the
          same quantity of pleasure in the consumer. Bentham was more attracted
          by the latter measure. By associating money so closely to inner
          experience, Davies writes, Bentham 'set the stage for the entangling
          of psychological research and capitalism that would shape the business
          practices of the twentieth century'.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <em>The Happiness Industry</em> describes how the project of a science
          of happiness has become integral to capitalism. We learn much that is
          interesting about how economic problems are being redefined and
          treated as psychological maladies. In addition, Davies shows how the
          belief that inner of pleasure and displeasure can be objectively
          measured has informed management studies and advertising. The tendency
          of thinkers such as J B Watson, the founder of behaviourism*, was that
          human beings could be shaped, or manipulated, by policymakers and
          managers. Watson had no factual basis for his view of human action.
          When he became president of the American Psychological Association in
          1915, he 'had never even studied a single human being': his research
          had been confined to experiments on white rats. Yet Watson's reductive
          model is now widely applied, with 'behaviour change' becoming the goal
          of governments: in Britain, a 'Behaviour Insights Team' has been
          established by the government to study how people can be encouraged,
          at minimum cost to the public purse, to live in what are considered to
          be socially desirable ways.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Modern industrial societies appear to need the possibility of
          ever-increasing happiness to motivate them in their labours. But
          whatever its intellectual pedigree, the idea that governments should
          be responsible for promoting happiness is always a threat to human
          freedom.
