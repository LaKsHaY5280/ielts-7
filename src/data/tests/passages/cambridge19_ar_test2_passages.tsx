          The Industrial Revolution in Britain
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the mid-1700s and by the
          1830s and 1840s had spread to many other parts of the world, including
          the United States. In Britain, it was a period when a largely rural,
          agrarian* society was transformed into an industrialised, urban one.
          Goods that had once been crafted by hand started to be produced in
          mass quantities by machines in factories, thanks to the invention of
          steam power and the introduction of new machines and manufacturing
          techniques in textiles, iron-making and other industries.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The foundations of the Industrial Revolution date back to the early
          1700s, when the English inventor Thomas Newcomen designed the first
          modern steam engine. Called the 'atmospheric steam engine', Newcomen's
          invention was originally used to power machines that pumped water out
          of mines. In the 1760s, the Scottish engineer James Watt started to
          adapt one of Newcomen's models, and succeeded in making it far more
          efficient. Watt later worked with the English manufacturer Matthew
          Boulton to invent a new steam engine driven by both the forward and
          backward strokes of the piston, while the gear mechanism it was
          connected to produced rotary motion. It was a key innovation that
          would allow steam power to spread across British industries.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The demand for coal, which was a relatively cheap energy source, grew
          rapidly during the Industrial Revolution, as it was needed to run not
          only the factories used to produce manufactured goods, but also
          steam-powered transportation. In the early 1800s, the English engineer
          Richard Trevithick built a steam-powered locomotive, and by 1830 goods
          and passengers were being transported between the industrial centres
          of Manchester and Liverpool. In addition, steam-powered boats and
          ships were widely used to carry goods along Britain's canals as well
          as across the Atlantic.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Britain had produced textiles like wool, linen and cotton, for
          hundreds of years, but prior to the Industrial Revolution, the British
          textile business was a true 'cottage industry', with the work
          performed in small workshops or even homes by individual spinners,
          weavers and dyers. Starting in the mid-1700s, innovations like the
          spinning jenny and the power loom made weaving cloth and spinning yarn
          and thread much easier. With these machines, relatively little labour
          was required to produce cloth, and the new, mechanised textile
          factories that opened around the country were quickly able to meet
          customer demand for cloth both at home and abroad.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          (* agrarian: relating to the land, especially the use of land for
          farming)
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The British iron industry also underwent major change as it adopted
          new innovations. Chief among the new techniques was the smelting of
          iron ore with coke (a material made by heating coal) instead of the
          traditional charcoal. This method was cheaper and produced metals that
          were of a higher quality, enabling Britain's iron and steel production
          to expand in response to demand created by the Napoleonic Wars
          (1803-15) and the expansion of the railways from the 1830s.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The latter part of the Industrial Revolution also saw key advances in
          communication methods, as people increasingly saw the need to
          communicate efficiently over long distances. In 1837, British
          inventors William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone patented the first
          commercial telegraphy system. In the 1830s and 1840s, Samuel Morse and
          other inventors worked on their own versions in the United States.
          Cooke and Wheatstone's system was soon used for railway signalling in
          the UK. As the speed of the new locomotives increased, it was
          essential to have a fast and effective means of avoiding collisions.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The impact of the Industrial Revolution on people's lives was immense.
          Although many people in Britain had begun moving to the cities from
          rural areas before the Industrial Revolution, this accelerated
          dramatically with industrialisation, as the rise of large factories
          turned smaller towns into major cities in just a few decades. This
          rapid urbanisation brought significant challenges, as overcrowded
          cities suffered from pollution and inadequate sanitation.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Although industrialisation increased the country's economic output
          overall and improved the standard of living for the middle and upper
          classes, many poor people continued to struggle. Factory workers had
          to work long hours in dangerous conditions for extremely low wages.
          These conditions along with the rapid pace of change fuelled
          opposition to industrialisation. A group of British workers who became
          known as 'Luddites' were British weavers and textile workers who
          objected to the increased use of mechanised looms and knitting frames.
          Many had spent years learning their craft, and they feared that
          unskilled machine operators were robbing them of their livelihood. A
          few desperate weavers began breaking into factories and smashing
          textile machines. They called themselves Luddites after Ned Ludd, a
          young apprentice who was rumoured to have wrecked a textile machine in
          1779.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The first major instances of machine breaking took place in 1811 in
          the city of Nottingham, and the practice soon spread across the
          country. Machine-breaking Luddites attacked and burned factories, and
          in some cases they even exchanged gunfire with company guards and
          soldiers. The workers wanted employers to stop installing new
          machinery, but the British government responded to the uprisings by
          making machine-breaking punishable by death. The unrest finally
          reached its peak in April 1812, when a few Luddites were shot during
          an attack on a mill near Huddersfield. In the days that followed,
          other Luddites were arrested, and dozens were hanged or transported to
          Australia. By 1813, the Luddite resistance had all but vanished.

        <p className="mb-4">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based
          on Reading Passage 2 below.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4">Athletes and stress</h3>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>A</strong> It isn't easy being a professional athlete. Not
          only are the physical demands greater than most people could handle,
          athletes also face intense psychological pressure during competition.
          This is something that British tennis player Emma Raducanu wrote about
          on social media following her withdrawal from the 2021 Wimbledon
          tournament. Though the young player had been doing well in the
          tournament, she began having difficulty regulating her breathing and
          heart rate during a match, which she later attributed to 'the
          accumulation of the excitement and the buzz'.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>B</strong> For athletes, some level of performance stress is
          almost unavoidable. But there are many different factors that dictate
          just how people's minds and bodies respond to stressful events.
          Typically, stress is the result of an exchange between two factors:
          demands and resources. An athlete may feel stressed about an event if
          they feel the demands on them are greater than they can handle. These
          demands include the high level of physical and mental effort required
          to succeed, and also the athlete's concerns about the difficulty of
          the event, their chance of succeeding, and any potential dangers such
          as injury. Resources, on the other hand, are a person's ability to
          cope with these demands. These include factors such as the
          competitor's degree of confidence, how much they believe they can
          control the situation's outcome, and whether they're looking forward
          to the event or not.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>C</strong> Each new demand or change in circumstances affects
          whether a person responds positively or negatively to stress.
          Typically, the more resources a person feels they have in handling the
          situation, the more positive their stress response. This positive
          stress response is called a challenge state. But should the person
          feel there are too many demands placed on them, the more likely they
          are to experience a negative stress response – known as a threat
          state. Research shows that the challenge states lead to good
          performance, while threat states lead to poorer performance. So, in
          Emma Raducanu's case, a much larger audience, higher expectations and
          facing a more skillful opponent, may all have led her to feel there
          were greater demands being placed on her at Wimbledon – but she didn't
          have the resources to tackle them. This led to her experiencing a
          threat response.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>D</strong> Our challenge and threat responses essentially
          influence how our body responds to stressful situations, as both
          affect the production of adrenaline and cortisol also known as 'stress
          hormones'. During a challenge state, adrenaline increases the amount
          of blood pumped from the heart and expands the blood vessels, which
          allows more energy to be delivered to the muscles and brain. This
          increase of blood and decrease of pressure in the blood vessels has
          been consistently related to superior sport performance in everything
          from cricket batting, to golf putting and football penalty taking. But
          during a threat state, cortisol inhibits the positive effect of
          adrenaline, resulting in tighter blood vessels, higher blood pressure,
          slower psychological responses, and a faster heart rate. In short, a
          threat state makes people more anxious – they make worse decisions and
          perform more poorly. In tennis players, cortisol has been associated
          with more unsuccessful serves and greater anxiety.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>E</strong> That said, anxiety is also a common experience for
          athletes when they're under pressure. Anxiety can increase heart rate
          and perspiration, cause heart palpitations, muscle tremors and
          shortness of breath, as well as headaches, nausea, stomach pain,
          weakness and a desire to escape in more extreme cases. Anxiety can
          also reduce concentration and self-control and cause overthinking. The
          intensity with which a person experiences anxiety depends on the
          demands and resources they have. Anxiety may also manifest itself in
          the form of excitement or nervousness depending on the stress
          response. Negative stress responses can be damaging to both physical
          and mental health – and repeated episodes of anxiety coupled with
          negative responses can increase risk of heart disease and depression.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>F</strong> But there are many ways athletes can ensure they
          respond positively under pressure. Positive stress responses can be
          promoted through the language that they and others – such as coaches
          or parents – use. Psychologists can also help athletes change how they
          see their physiological responses – such as helping them see a higher
          heart rate as excitement, rather than nerves. Developing psychological
          skills, such as visualisation, can also help decrease physiological
          responses to threat. Visualisation may involve the athlete recreating
          a mental picture of a time when they performed well, or picturing
          themselves doing well in the future. This can help create a feeling of
          control over the stressful event. Recreating competitive pressure
          during training can also help athletes learn how to deal with stress.
          An example of this might be scoring athletes against their peers to
          create a sense of competition. This would increase the demands which
          players experience compared to a normal training session, while still
          allowing them to practise coping with stress.

          You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based
          on Reading Passage 3 below.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4">
          An inquiry into the existence of the gifted child
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Let us start by looking at a modern 'genius', Maryam Mirzakhani, who
          died at the early age of 40. She was the only woman to win the Fields
          Medal – the mathematical equivalent of a Nobel prize. It would be easy
          to assume that someone as special as Mirzakhani must have been one of
          those 'gifted' children, those who have an extraordinary ability in a
          specific sphere of activity or knowledge. But look closer and a
          different story emerges. Mirzakhani was born in Tehran, Iran. She went
          to a highly selective girls' school but maths wasn't her interest –
          reading was. She loved novels and would read anything she could lay
          her hands on. As for maths, she did rather poorly at it for the first
          couple of years in her middle school, but became interested when her
          elder brother told her about what he'd learned. He shared a famous
          maths problem from a magazine that fascinated her – and she was
          hooked.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          In adult life it is clear that she was curious, excited by what she
          did and also resolute in the face of setbacks. One of her comments
          sums it up. 'Of course, the most rewarding part is the "Aha" moment,
          the excitement of discovery and enjoyment of understanding something
          new . . . But most of the time, doing mathematics for me is like being
          on a long hike with no trail and no end in sight.' That trail took her
          to the heights of original research into mathematics.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Is her background unusual? Apparently not. Most Nobel prize winners
          were unexceptional in childhood. Einstein was slow to talk as a baby.
          He failed the general part of the entry test to Zurich Polytechnic –
          though they let him in because of high physics and maths scores. He
          struggled at work initially, but he kept plugging away and eventually
          rewrote the laws of Newtonian mechanics with his theory of relativity.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          There has been a considerable amount of research on high performance
          over the last century that suggests it goes way beyond tested
          intelligence. On top of that, research is clear that brains are
          flexible, new neural pathways can be created, and IQ isn't fixed. For
          example, just because you can read stories with hundreds of pages at
          the age of five doesn't mean you will still be ahead of your
          contemporaries in your teens.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          While the jury is out on giftedness being innate and other factors
          potentially making the difference, what is certain is that the
          behaviours associated with high levels of performance are replicable
          and most can be taught – even traits such as curiosity.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          According to my colleague Prof Deborah Eyre, with whom I've
          collaborated on the book Great Minds and How to Grow Them, the latest
          neuroscience and psychological research suggests most individuals can
          reach levels of performance associated in school with the gifted and
          talented. However, they must be taught the right attitudes and
          approaches to their learning and develop the attributes of high
          performers – curiosity, persistence and hard work, for example – an
          approach Eyre calls 'high performance learning'. Critically, they need
          the right support in developing those approaches at home as well as at
          school.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Prof Anders Ericsson, an eminent education psychologist at Florida
          State University, US, is the co-author of Peak: Secrets from the New
          Science of Expertise. After research going back to 1980 into diverse
          achievements, from music to memory to sport, he doesn't think unique
          and innate talents are at the heart of performance. Deliberate
          practice, that stretches you every step of the way, and around 10,000
          hours of it, is what produces the goods. It's not a magic number – the
          highest performers move on to doing a whole lot more, of course.
          Ericsson's memory research is particularly interesting because random
          students, trained in memory techniques for the study, went on to
          outperform others thought to have innately superior memories – those
          who you might call gifted.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          But it is perhaps the work of Benjamin Bloom, another distinguished
          American educationist working in the 1980s, that gives the most pause
          for thought. Bloom's team looked at a group of extraordinarily high
          achieving people in disciplines as varied as ballet, swimming, piano,
          tennis, maths, sculpture and neurology. He found a pattern of parents
          encouraging and supporting their children, often in areas they enjoyed
          themselves. Bloom's outstanding people had worked very hard and
          consistently at something they had become hooked on when at a young
          age, and their parents all emerged as having strong work ethics
          themselves.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Eyre says we know how high performers learn. From that she has
          developed a high performing learning approach. She is working on this
          with a group of schools, both in Britain and abroad. Some spin-off
          research, which looked in detail at 24 of the 3,000 children being
          studied who were succeeding despite difficult circumstances, found
          something remarkable. Half were getting free school meals because of
          poverty, more than half were living with a single parent, and four in
          five were living in disadvantaged areas. Interviews uncovered strong
          evidence of an adult or adults in the child's life who valued and
          supported education, either in the immediate or extended family or in
          the child's wider community. Children talked about the need to work
          hard at school, to listen in class and keep trying.

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Let us end with Einstein, the epitome of a genius. He clearly had
          curiosity, character and determination. He struggled against rejection
          in early life but was undeterred. Did he think he was a genius or even
          gifted? He once wrote: 'It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I
          stay with problems longer. Most people say it is the intellect which
          makes a great scientist. They are wrong: it is character.'
