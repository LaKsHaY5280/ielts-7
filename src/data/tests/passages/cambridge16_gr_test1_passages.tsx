        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 15-27</strong>,
          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">An Introduction to Hydroponics</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Hydroponics is the practice of growing plants without soil. Instead,
          plants are grown in a solution of water and nutrients, or in a medium
          such as gravel, sand, or rockwool to which the nutrient solution is
          added. The word 'hydroponics' comes from the Greek words 'hydro'
          meaning water and 'ponos' meaning labor.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          While the technology may seem modern, the practice is ancient. The
          hanging gardens of Babylon, one of the seven wonders of the ancient
          world, are believed to have used hydroponic principles. The Aztecs
          developed a system of floating gardens called 'chinampas', where
          plants grew on the surface of a lake. Chinese farmers have practiced
          various forms of hydroponic growing for centuries.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Modern hydroponics began in the mid-19th century when researchers
          discovered that plants absorb essential mineral nutrients as inorganic
          ions in water. In the 1930s, Dr. William Gericke of the University of
          California at Berkeley began promoting the practical application of
          hydroponics for growing crops. During World War II, hydroponics was
          used to produce fresh vegetables for troops stationed on non-arable
          islands in the Pacific. In the 1960s and 1970s, hydroponic techniques
          were further refined, leading to broader commercial applications.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Today, hydroponics is used both commercially and by hobbyists.
          Commercial growers use it to produce vegetables, fruits, herbs, and
          even flowers. Most commercial hydroponic operations are large
          greenhouse facilities, though smaller operations exist in urban
          environments, often utilizing vertical farming techniques to maximize
          space.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There are several different types of hydroponic systems. The simplest
          is the Wick System, where a wick draws nutrient solution from a
          reservoir to the growing medium. The Ebb and Flow (or Flood and Drain)
          system temporarily floods the growing medium with nutrient solution
          and then drains it back into the reservoir. The Nutrient Film
          Technique (NFT) continuously flows a thin film of nutrient solution
          over the roots. In the Water Culture system, plant roots are suspended
          directly into the nutrient solution. Aeroponics suspends plants in air
          and mists the roots with nutrient solution.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Regardless of the specific technique, all hydroponic systems share
          certain advantages over traditional soil-based growing. One key
          benefit is water conservation. Hydroponic systems use up to 90% less
          water than traditional soil-based agriculture because the water in the
          system is recirculated rather than draining away or evaporating. This
          makes hydroponics particularly valuable in areas with limited water
          resources.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Another advantage is space efficiency. Because plant roots don't need
          to spread out in search of nutrients, hydroponic plants can be grown
          much closer together than soil-grown plants. Furthermore, because they
          don't rely on seasons or climate, hydroponic systems can operate
          year-round in any location. This ability to grow food locally
          regardless of climate has significant potential for reducing the
          environmental impact of transporting food long distances.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Hydroponics also allows for precise control over nutrient delivery. In
          traditional agriculture, farmers apply fertilizers to soil, but they
          have limited control over how much of those nutrients actually reach
          the plants. In hydroponics, nutrients are delivered directly to the
          plant roots in precise amounts, reducing waste and optimizing plant
          growth.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Moreover, hydroponic growing eliminates the need for pesticides and
          herbicides. Without soil, there are fewer pests and diseases, and no
          weeds to compete with crops for nutrients. This results in healthier
          plants and eliminates the potential environmental impacts of
          agricultural chemicals.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Despite these advantages, hydroponics also presents challenges.
          Setting up a hydroponic system requires an initial investment in
          equipment. Commercial systems in particular can be expensive to
          establish, though costs have been decreasing as technology improves
          and becomes more widespread. Additionally, hydroponic systems rely on
          electricity for pumps and timers, making them vulnerable to power
          outages. They also require technical knowledge to maintain proper
          nutrient levels, pH, and other factors to ensure healthy plant growth.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          For those interested in starting with hydroponics, there are many
          resources available. Books, websites, and online forums provide
          information on building and maintaining different types of systems.
          Pre-made kits are available for purchase, ranging from simple
          countertop herb gardens to larger systems capable of producing a
          significant amount of food. Many gardening and hydroponics supply
          stores offer classes and workshops for beginners.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Looking to the future, hydroponics is likely to play an increasingly
          important role in global food production. As the world's population
          continues to grow and arable land becomes scarcer, the ability to grow
          food efficiently in any location will become even more valuable.
          Innovations in technology are making hydroponic systems more efficient
          and easier to use. For example, automated systems can now monitor and
          adjust nutrient levels, pH, and lighting without human intervention.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Hydroponics is also enabling new approaches to agriculture, such as
          vertical farming in urban environments. By growing crops in stacked
          layers in buildings, vertical farms can produce large amounts of food
          in small footprints, bringing production closer to consumers. Some
          vertical farms are being integrated into residential buildings,
          supermarkets, and restaurants, providing ultra-fresh produce with
          minimal transportation.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In conclusion, while hydroponics may not completely replace
          traditional agriculture, it offers a promising complement to existing
          methods. By addressing issues of water scarcity, land use, and
          environmental impact, hydroponics has the potential to contribute
          significantly to sustainable food production in the 21st century and
          beyond.

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 28-40</strong>,
          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">The Psychology of Queuing</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Standing in line is an almost universal human experience. From bank
          tellers to supermarket checkouts, from amusement park rides to airport
          security, we spend a considerable portion of our lives waiting in
          lines. But what seems like a simple process – people arriving at a
          service point and waiting their turn – is in fact a complex
          psychological and sociological phenomenon that has been studied
          extensively by researchers.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The science of queue psychology began in earnest in the 1950s with the
          work of queueing theory pioneer David Maister. His influential paper,
          "The Psychology of Waiting Lines," identified several principles that
          still guide how businesses manage queues today. Maister observed that
          our perception of time spent waiting often matters more than the
          actual time itself. In other words, a wait that feels short is better
          than one that actually is short but feels long. This insight
          transformed how businesses approach queue management.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Perhaps the most widely recognized psychological principle related to
          queuing is that occupied time feels shorter than unoccupied time. When
          we have something to distract us, we perceive waiting time as passing
          more quickly. This is why many businesses now provide diversions for
          people in queues – from televisions in waiting rooms to mirrors near
          elevators (people enjoy looking at themselves and time passes more
          quickly when they do). Disney theme parks, masters of queue
          management, design their waiting areas as part of the attraction
          experience, with themed environments, videos about the upcoming ride,
          and interactive elements to keep visitors engaged.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Another key principle is that anxiety makes waits seem longer. When
          we're uncertain about how long we'll wait or whether we're in the
          right line, our anxiety increases and so does our perception of time.
          This explains why many businesses now use numbered tickets or digital
          queuing systems that tell customers exactly where they stand in line
          and approximately how long they'll wait. Some restaurants provide time
          estimates when adding patrons to a waiting list, while others
          deliberately overestimate wait times so customers are pleasantly
          surprised when they're seated "early."
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          People generally prefer fairness in queuing situations, which is why
          "first come, first served" is the dominant model in most cultures.
          When this norm is violated – when someone cuts in line, for example –
          it can provoke strong negative emotions. Studies have shown that
          perceived injustice in queues can lead to aggressiveness and even
          violence in extreme cases. However, there are cultural variations in
          queuing behavior. In some cultures, maintaining personal space while
          queuing is important, while in others, physical proximity is more
          acceptable. In some societies, orderly queuing is strictly observed,
          while in others, a more competitive approach to gaining service is the
          norm.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Interestingly, researchers have found that in many situations, a
          single queue feeding multiple service points (like a bank with one
          line feeding multiple tellers) is not only more efficient but is
          perceived as fairer and less stressful by customers. This is because
          it eliminates the "wrong line" phenomenon – the anxiety that comes
          from choosing between multiple lines and then watching another line
          move faster than yours. The single serpentine line ensures that
          everyone is served strictly in the order they arrived.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The perception of queue length also influences customer behavior.
          Studies show that people are more likely to balk (decide not to join)
          or renege (leave after joining) if a queue appears too long. This is
          why some businesses deliberately hide the full extent of their queues,
          for instance by having them wind around corners. Conversely, visible
          queues can sometimes be advantageous – a restaurant with people
          waiting outside may signal popularity and quality to passersby.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The pain of waiting is also affected by our expectations. When a
          service takes longer than expected, dissatisfaction increases
          dramatically. On the other hand, when service is faster than expected,
          customer satisfaction soars. This asymmetry has led to the practice of
          "under-promising and over-delivering" when it comes to wait times.
          Additionally, waits of uncertain duration are more stressful than
          known, finite waits. This explains why progress bars on computers and
          countdown timers at pedestrian crossings have become common features
          of modern life.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The final moments of a wait carry disproportionate weight in how we
          remember the entire experience. This is an example of what
          psychologists call the "peak-end rule," where our memory of an
          experience is shaped primarily by its most intense point (the peak)
          and how it ended. A long wait that ends well – perhaps with
          exceptional service or a small gesture like a sincere apology for the
          delay – may be remembered more positively than a shorter wait with a
          negative ending.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Technology is changing how we queue in many situations. Virtual
          queuing systems allow people to register for service and then do other
          things until their turn approaches. Mobile apps let customers join a
          restaurant waitlist before arriving or schedule appointments instead
          of waiting. These technologies address many of the psychological pain
          points of traditional queuing – they occupy time that would otherwise
          be spent waiting, reduce anxiety by providing information, and create
          a sense of progressing toward the goal.

          However, these innovations also create new challenges. Digital divides
          mean that not everyone has equal access to virtual queuing technology.
          And while many younger customers prefer digital queues, some older
          customers may find traditional queuing more familiar and less
          stressful. Businesses must therefore be thoughtful about how they
          implement new queuing systems to ensure they're serving all their
          customers effectively.

          The COVID-19 pandemic brought about further changes to queuing
          behavior. Social distancing requirements led to new queue management
          techniques, with spaced markers on floors and limited numbers of
          people allowed in stores simultaneously. These practices may have
          lasting effects on how we think about personal space in queues, even
          as the immediate health concerns recede.

        <p className="mb-4">
          What the psychology of queuing ultimately teaches us is that waiting
          is not just about time – it's about emotion, perception, fairness,
          information, and expectations. By understanding these dimensions,
          organizations can design waiting experiences that minimize frustration
          and even, in some cases, become positive parts of the overall customer
          journey. And as individuals, understanding the psychology behind our
          reactions to waiting might just make our next queue a little more
          bearable.
