          The impact of climate change on butterflies in Britain
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          According to conservationists, populations of around two thirds of
          butterfly species have declined in Britain over the past 40 years. If
          this trend continues, it might have unpredictable knock-on effects for
          other species in the ecosystem. Butterfly eggs develop into
          caterpillars and these insects, which are the second stage in a new
          butterfly's lifecycle, consume vast quantities of plant material, and
          in turn act as prey for birds as well as bats and other small mammals.
          Only by arming themselves with an understanding of why butterfly
          numbers are down can conservationists hope to halt or reverse the
          decline.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Butterflies prefer outdoor conditions to be 'just right', which means
          neither too hot nor too cold. Under the conditions of climate change,
          the temperature at any given time in summer is generally getting
          warmer, leaving butterflies with the challenge of how to deal with
          this. One of the main ways in which species are ensuring conditions
          suit them is by changing the time of year at which they are active and
          reproduce. Scientists refer to the timing of such lifecycle events as
          'phenology', so when an animal or plant starts to do something earlier
          in the year than it usually does, it is said to be 'advancing its
          phenology'.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          These advances have been observed already in a wide range of
          butterflies – indeed, most species are advancing their phenology to
          some extent. In Britain, as the average spring temperature has
          increased by roughly 0.5°C over the past 20 years, species have
          advanced by between three days and a week on average, to keep in line
          with cooler temperatures. Is this a sign that butterflies are well
          equipped to cope with climate change, and readily adjust to new
          temperatures? Or are these populations under stress, being dragged
          along unwillingly by unnaturally fast changes? The answer is still
          unknown, but a new study is seeking to answer these questions.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          First, the researchers pulled together data from millions of records
          that had been submitted by butterfly enthusiasts – people who spend
          their free time observing the activities of different species. This
          provided information on 130 species of butterflies in Great Britain
          every year for a 20-year period. They then estimated the abundance and
          distribution of each species across this time, along with how far
          north in the country they had moved. The data also, crucially, allowed
          researchers to estimate subtle changes in what time of the year each
          species was changing into an adult butterfly.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Analysing the trends in each variable, the researchers discovered that
          species with more flexible lifecycles were more likely to be able to
          benefit from an earlier emergence driven by climate change. Some
          species are able to go from caterpillar to butterfly twice or more per
          year, so that the individual butterflies you see flying in the spring
          are the grandchildren or great-grandchildren of the individuals seen a
          year previously.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Among these species, researchers observed that those which have been
          advancing their phenology the most over the 20-year study period also
          had the most positive trends in abundance, distribution and northwards
          extent. For these species, such as Britain's tiniest butterfly, the
          dainty Small Blue, whose colonies are up to a hundred strong, some
          develop into butterflies early in spring, allowing their summer
          generations to complete another reproductive cycle by autumn so that
          more population growth occurs.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Other species, however, are less flexible and restricted to a single
          reproductive cycle per year. For these species, there was no evidence
          of any benefit to emerging earlier. Indeed, worryingly, it was found
          that the species in this group that specialise in very specific
          habitat types, often related to the caterpillar's preferred diet,
          actually tended to be most at harm from advancing phenology. The
          beautiful High Brown Fritillary, often described as Britain's most
          endangered butterfly, is in this group. It is found only in coppiced
          woodland and limestone pavement habitats. It is also a
          single-generation butterfly that has advanced its phenology. This
          suggests that climate change, while undoubtedly not the sole cause,
          might have played a part in the downfall of this species.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          All is not lost, however. Many of Britain's single-generation species
          show the capacity, in continental Europe, to add a second generation
          in years that are sufficiently warm. Therefore, as the climate
          continues to warm, species like the Silver-studded Blue might be able
          to switch to multiple generations in the UK as well, and so begin to
          extract benefits from the additional warmth, potentially leading to
          population increases.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          More immediately, conservationists can arm themselves with all this
          knowledge to spot the warning signs of species that may be at risk.
          The White Admiral of southern England, a much sought-after butterfly,
          experienced a significant increase in numbers from the 1920s but has
          shown a considerable decline in the past 20 years. This may be because
          the caterpillar exists solely on a diet of a plant called honeysuckle.
          But it is also likely to be due to climate change.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-center">Deep-sea mining</h3>
        <p className="italic text-center mb-4">
          Bacteria from the ocean floor can beat superbugs and cancer. But
          habitats are at risk from the hunger for marine minerals
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>A</strong> When Professor Mat Upton found that a microbe from
          a deep-sea sponge was killing pathogenic bugs in his laboratory, he
          realised it could be a breakthrough in the fight against
          antibiotic-resistant superbugs, which are responsible for thousands of
          deaths a year in the UK alone. Further tests confirmed that an
          antibiotic from the sponge bacteria, found living more than 700 metres
          under the sea at the Rockall trough in the north-east Atlantic, was
          previously unknown to science, boosting its potential as a life-saving
          medicine. But Upton, and other scientists who view the deep ocean and
          its wealth of unique and undocumented species as a prospecting ground
          for new medicines, fear such potential will be lost in the rush to
          exploit the deep sea's equally rich metal and mineral resources.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>B</strong> 'We're looking at the bioactive potential of marine
          resources, to see if there are any more medicines or drugs down there
          before we destroy it for ever,' says Upton, a medical microbiologist
          at the University of Plymouth. He is among many scientists urging a
          halt to deep-sea mining, asking for time to weigh up the pros and
          cons. 'In sustainability terms, this could be a better way of
          exploiting the economic potential of the deep sea,' he argues.
          Oceanographers using remotely operated vehicles have spotted many new
          species. Among them have been sea cucumbers with tails allowing them
          to sail along the ocean floor, and a rare 'Dumbo' octopus, found 3,000
          metres under the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of California. Any one
          of these could offer lifesaving potential. Upton estimates it could
          take up to a decade for a newly discovered antibiotic to become a
          medicine – but the race towards commercial mining in the ocean abyss
          has already begun.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>C</strong> The deep sea contains more nickel, cobalt and rare
          earth metals than all land reserves combined, according to the US
          Geological Survey. Mining corporations argue that deepsea exploration
          could help diversify the supply of metals and point to the fact that
          demand for resources such as copper, aluminium, cobalt for electric
          car batteries and other metals to power technology and smartphones, is
          soaring. They say that deep-sea mining could yield far superior ore to
          land mining with little, if any, waste. Different methods of
          extraction exist, but most involve employing some form of converted
          machinery previously used in terrestrial mining to excavate materials
          from the sea floor, at depths of up to 6,000 metres, then drawing a
          seawater slurry, containing rock and other solid particles, from the
          sea floor to ships on the surface. The slurry is then 'de-watered' and
          transferred to another vessel for shipping. Extracted seawater is
          pumped back down and discharged close to the sea floor.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>D</strong> But environmental and legal groups have urged
          caution, arguing there are potentially massive and unknown
          ramifications for the environment and for nearby communities, and that
          the global regulatory framework is not yet drafted. 'Despite arising
          in the last half century, the "new global gold rush" of deep-sea
          mining shares many features with past resource scrambles – including a
          general disregard for environmental and social impacts, and the
          marginalisation of indigenous peoples and their rights,' a paper,
          written by Julie Hunter and Julian Aguon, from Blue Ocean Law, and
          Pradeep Singh, from the Center for Marine Environmental Sciences,
          Bremen, argues. The authors say that knowledge of the deep seabed
          remains extremely limited. 'The surface of the Moon, Mars and even
          Venus have all been mapped and studied in much greater detail, leading
          marine scientists to commonly remark that, with respect to the deep
          sea, "We don't yet know what we need to know".'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>E</strong> Scientific research – including a recent paper in
          Marine Policy journal – has suggested the deep seabed, and
          hydrothermal vents, which are created when seawater meets volcanic
          magma, have crucial impacts upon biodiversity and the global climate.
          The mineral-rich vents and their surrounds are also home to many
          well-known animals including crustaceans, tubeworms, clams, slugs,
          anemones and fish. 'It is becoming increasingly clear that deepsea
          mining poses a grave threat to these vital seabed functions,' the
          paper says. 'Extraction methods would produce large sediment plumes
          and involve the discharge of waste back into the ocean, significantly
          disturbing seafloor environments,' the paper continues. 'On deep sea
          vents, scientists are clear,' says Dr Jon Copley of the National
          Oceanography Centre, Southampton: 'we don't want mining on them.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>F</strong> The oceans occupy around 70% of the planet and are
          relatively unexplored, says Mike Johnston, chief executive of
          Nautilus, a Canadian underwater exploration company: 'It makes sense
          to explore this untapped potential in an environmentally sustainable
          way, instead of continually looking at the fast depleting land
          resources of the planet to meet society's rising needs.' Those leading
          the global rush to place giant mining machines thousands of metres
          below the sea surface say the environmental impacts will be far lower
          than on land. But critics say exotic and little-known ecosystems in
          the deep oceans could be destroyed and must be protected. 'Mining will
          be the greatest assault on deep-sea ecosystems ever inflicted by
          humans,' according to hydrothermal vent expert Verena Tunnicliffe, at
          the University of Victoria in Canada. She argues that active vents
          must be off-limits for mining to protect the new knowledge and
          biotechnology spin-offs they can deliver, and that strict controls
          must be in place elsewhere.

          The Unselfish Gene
        </h3>
        <p className="italic text-center mb-4">
          A psychologist gives his view on how humans became self-centred
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          There has long been a general assumption that human beings are
          essentially selfish. We're apparently ruthless, with strong impulses
          to compete against each other for resources and to accumulate power
          and possessions. If we are kind to one another, it's usually because
          we have ulterior motives. If we are good, it's only because we have
          managed to control and transcend our innate selfishness and brutality.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          This bleak view of human nature is closely associated with the science
          writer Richard Dawkins, whose 1976 book The Selfish Gene became
          popular because it fitted so well with – and helped to justify – the
          competitive and individualistic ethos that was so prevalent in late
          20th-century societies. Like many others, Dawkins justifies his views
          with reference to the field of evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary
          psychology theorises that present-day human traits developed in
          prehistoric times, during what is termed the 'environment of
          evolutionary adaptedness'.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Prehistory is usually seen as a period of intense competition, when
          life was such a brutal battle that only those with traits such as
          selfishness, aggression and ruthlessness survived. And because
          survival depended on access to resources – such as rivers, forests and
          animals – there was bound to be conflict between rival groups, which
          led to the development of traits such as racism and warfare. This
          seems logical. But, in fact, the assumption on which this all rests –
          that prehistoric life was a desperate struggle for survival – is
          false.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          It's important to remember that in the prehistoric era, the world was
          very sparsely populated. According to some estimates, around 15,000
          years ago, the population of Europe was only 29,000, and the
          population of the whole world was less than half a million. Humans at
          that time were hunter-gatherers: people who lived by hunting wild
          animals and collecting wild plants. With such small population
          densities, it seems unlikely that prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups
          had to compete against each other for resources or had any need to
          develop ruthlessness and competitiveness, or to go to war.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          There is significant evidence to back this notion from contemporary
          hunter-gatherer groups, who live in the same way as prehistoric humans
          did. As the anthropologist Bruce Knauft has remarked, hunter-gatherers
          are characterised by 'extreme political and sexual egalitarianism'.
          Knauft has observed that individuals in such groups don't accumulate
          property or possessions and have an ethical obligation to share
          everything. They also have methods of preserving egalitarianism by
          ensuring that disparities of status don't arise.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The !Kung people of southern Africa, for example, swap arrows before
          going hunting and when an animal is killed, the acclaim does not go to
          the person who fired the arrow, but to the person the arrow belongs
          to. And if a person becomes too domineering, the other members of the
          group ostracise them, exiling the offender from society. Typically in
          such groups, men do not dictate what women do. Women in
          hunter-gatherer groups worldwide often benefit from a high level of
          autonomy, being able to select their own marriage partners, decide
          what work they do and work whenever they choose to. And if a marriage
          breaks down, they have custody rights over their children.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Many anthropologists believe that societies such as the !Kung were
          normal until a few thousand years ago, when population growth led to
          the development of agriculture and a settled lifestyle. In view of the
          above, there seems little reason to assume that traits such as racism,
          warfare and male domination should have been selected by evolution as
          they would have been of little benefit in the prehistoric era.
          Individuals who behaved selfishly and ruthlessly would be less likely
          to survive, since they would have been ostracised from their groups.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          It makes more sense, then, to see traits such as cooperation,
          egalitarianism, altruism and peacefulness as innate characteristics of
          human beings. These were the traits that were prevalent in human life
          for tens of thousands of years. So presumably these traits are still
          strong in us now.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          But if prehistoric life wasn't really as brutal as has often been
          assumed, why do modern humans behave so selfishly and ruthlessly?
          Perhaps these negative traits should be seen as a later development,
          the result of environmental and psychological factors. Research has
          shown repeatedly that when the natural habitats of primates such as
          apes and gorillas are disrupted, they tend to become more violent and
          hierarchical.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          So, it could well be that the same thing has happened to us. I believe
          that the end of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle and the advent of
          farming was connected to a psychological change that occurred in some
          groups of people. There was a new sense of individuality and
          separateness, which led to a new selfishness, and ultimately to
          hierarchical societies, patriarchy and warfare. At any rate, these
          negative traits appear to have developed so recently that it doesn't
          seem feasible to explain them in adaptive or evolutionary terms.
