        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">The Dead Sea Scrolls</h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In late 1946 or early 1947, three Bedouin teenagers were tending their
          goats and sheep near the ancient settlement of Qumran, located on the
          northwest shore of the Dead Sea in what is now known as the West Bank.
          One of these young shepherds tossed a rock into an opening on the side
          of a cliff and was surprised to hear a shattering sound. He and his
          companions later entered the cave and stumbled across a collection of
          large clay jars, seven of which contained scrolls with writing on
          them. The teenagers took the seven scrolls to a nearby town where they
          were sold for a small sum to a local antiquities dealer. Word of the
          find spread, and Bedouins and archaeologists eventually unearthed tens
          of thousands of additional scroll fragments from 10 nearby caves;
          together they make up between 800 and 900 manuscripts. It soon became
          clear that this was one of the greatest archaeological discoveries
          ever made.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The origin of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which were written around 2,000
          years ago between 150 BCE and 70 CE, is still the subject of scholarly
          debate even today. According to the prevailing theory, they are the
          work of a population that inhabited the area until Roman troops
          destroyed the settlement around 70 CE. The area was known as Judea at
          that time, and the people are thought to have belonged to a group
          called the Essenes, a devout Jewish sect.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The majority of the texts on the Dead Sea Scrolls are in Hebrew, with
          some fragments written in an ancient version of its alphabet thought
          to have fallen out of use in the fifth century BCE. But there are
          other languages as well. Some scrolls are in Aramaic, the language
          spoken by many inhabitants of the region from the sixth century BCE to
          the siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. In addition, several texts feature
          translations of the Hebrew Bible into Greek.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Dead Sea Scrolls include fragments from every book of the Old
          Testament of the Bible except for the Book of Esther. The only entire
          book of the Hebrew Bible preserved among the manuscripts from Qumran
          is Isaiah; this copy, dated to the first century BCE, is considered
          the earliest biblical manuscript still in existence. Along with
          biblical texts, the scrolls include documents about sectarian
          regulations and religious writings that do not appear in the Old
          Testament.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The writing on the Dead Sea Scrolls is mostly in black or occasionally
          red ink, and the scrolls themselves are nearly all made of neither
          parchment (animal skin) or an early form of paper called 'papyrus'.
          The only exception is the scroll numbered 3Q15, which was created out
          of a combination of copper and tin. Known as the Copper Scroll, this
          curious document features letters chiselled onto metal – perhaps, as
          some have theorized, to better withstand the passage of time. One of
          the most intriguing manuscripts from Qumran, this is a sort of ancient
          treasure map that lists dozens of gold and silver caches. Using an
          unconventional vocabulary and odd spelling, it describes 64
          underground hiding places that supposedly contain riches buried for
          safekeeping. None of these hoards have been recovered, possibly
          because the Romans pillaged Judea during the first century CE.
          According to various hypotheses, the treasure belonged to local
          people, or was rescued from the Second Temple before its destruction
          or never existed to begin with.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Some of the Dead Sea Scrolls have been on interesting journeys. In
          1948, a Syrian Orthodox archbishop known as Mar Samuel acquired four
          of the original seven scrolls from a Jerusalem shoemaker and part-time
          antiquity dealer, paying less than $100 for them. He then travelled to
          the United States and unsuccessfully offered them to a number of
          universities, including Yale. Finally, in 1954, he placed an
          advertisement in the business newspaper{" "}
          <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> – under the category 'Miscellaneous
          Items for Sale' – that read: 'Biblical Manuscripts dating back to at
          least 200 B.C. are for sale. This would be an ideal gift to an
          educational or religious institution by an individual or group.'
          Fortunately, Israeli archaeologist and statesman Yigael Yadin
          negotiated their purchase and brought the scrolls back to Jerusalem,
          where they remain to this day.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In 2017, researchers from the University of Haifa restored and
          deciphered one of the last untranslated scrolls. The university's
          Eshbal Ratson and Jonathan Ben-Dov spent one year reassembling the 60
          fragments that make up the scroll. Deciphered from a band of coded
          text on parchment, the find provides insight into the community of
          people who wrote it and the 364-day calendar they would have used. The
          scroll names celebrations that indicate shifts in seasons and details
          two yearly religious events known from another Dead Sea Scroll. Only
          one more known scroll remains untranslated.

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 14-26</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">
          A second attempt at domesticating the tomato
        </h3>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          It took at least 3,000 years for humans to learn how to domesticate
          the wild tomato and cultivate it for food. Now two separate teams in
          Brazil and China have done it all over again in less than three years.
          And they have done it better in some ways, as the re-domesticated
          tomatoes are more nutritious than the ones we eat at present.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          This approach relies on the revolutionary CRISPR genome editing
          technique, in which changes are deliberately made to the DNA of a
          living cell, allowing genetic material to be added, removed or
          altered. The technique could not only improve existing crops, but
          could also be used to turn thousands of wild plants into useful and
          appealing foods. In fact, a third team in the US has already begun to
          do this with a relative of the tomato called the groundcherry.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          This fast-track domestication could help make the world's food supply
          healthier and far more resistant to diseases, such as the rust fungus
          devastating wheat crops.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'This could transform what we eat,' says Jorg Kudla at the University
          of Munster in Germany, a member of the Brazilian team. 'There are
          50,000 edible plants in the world, but 90 percent of our energy comes
          from just 15 crops.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'We can now mimic the known domestication course of major crops like
          rice, maize, sorghum or others,' says Caixia Gao of the Chinese
          Academy of Sciences in Beijing. 'Then we might try to domesticate
          plants that have never been domesticated.'
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Wild tomatoes, which are native to the Andes region in South America,
          produce pea-sized fruits. Over many generations, peoples such as the
          Aztecs and Incas transformed the plant by selecting and breeding
          plants with mutations* in their genetic structure, which resulted in
          desirable traits such as larger fruit.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But every time a single plant with a mutation is taken from a larger
          population for breeding, much genetic diversity is lost. And sometimes
          the desirable mutations come with less desirable traits. For instance,
          the tomato strains grown for supermarkets have lost much of their
          flavour.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          By comparing the genomes of modern plants to those of their wild
          relatives, biologists have been working out what genetic changes
          occurred as plants were domesticated. The teams in Brazil and China
          have now used this knowledge to reintroduce these changes from scratch
          while maintaining or even enhancing the desirable traits of wild
          strains.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Kudla's team made six changes altogether. For instance, they tripled
          the size of fruit by editing a gene called FRUIT WEIGHT, and increased
          the number of tomatoes per truss by editing another called MULTIFLORA.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          While the historical domestication of tomatoes reduced levels of the
          red pigment lycopene – thought to have potential health benefits – the
          team in Brazil managed to boost it instead. The wild tomato has twice
          as much lycopene as cultivated ones; the newly domesticated one has
          five times as much.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          'They are quite tasty,' says Kudla. 'A little bit strong. And very
          aromatic.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The team in China re-domesticated several strains of wild tomatoes
          with desirable traits lost in domesticated tomatoes. In this way they
          managed to create a strain resistant to a common disease called
          bacterial spot race, which can devastate yields. They also created
          another strain that is more salt tolerant – and has higher levels of
          vitamin C.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Meanwhile, Joyce Van Eck at the Boyce Thompson Institute in New York
          state decided to use the same approach to domesticate the groundcherry
          or goldenberry (<em>Physalis pruinosa</em>) for the first time. This
          fruit looks similar to the closely related Cape gooseberry (
          <em>Physalis peruviana</em>).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Groundcherries are already sold to a limited extent in the US but they
          are hard to produce because the plant has a sprawling growth habit and
          the small fruits fall off the branches when ripe. Van Eck's team has
          edited the plants to increase fruit size, make their growth more
          compact and to stop fruits dropping. 'There's potential for this to be
          a commercial crop,' says Van Eck. But she adds that taking the work
          further would be expensive because of the need to pay for a licence
          for the CRISPR technology and get regulatory approval.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This approach could boost the use of many obscure plants, says
          Jonathan Jones of the Sainsbury Lab in the UK. But it will be hard for
          new foods to grow so popular with farmers and consumers that they
          become new staple crops, he thinks.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The three teams already have their eye on other plants that could be
          'catapulted into the mainstream', including foxtail, oat-grass and
          cowpea. By choosing wild plants that are drought or heat tolerant,
          says Gao, we could create crops that will thrive even as the planet
          warms.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But Kudla didn't want to reveal which species were in his team's
          sights, because CRISPR has made the process so easy. 'Any one with the
          right skills could go to their lab and do this.'

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Insight or evolution?</h3>

        <p className="mb-4 italic">
          Two scientists consider the origins of discoveries and other
          innovative behavior
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Scientific discovery is popularly believed to result from the sheer
          genius of such intellectual stars as naturalist Charles Darwin and
          theoretical physicist Albert Einstein. Our view of such unique
          contributions to science often disregards the person's prior
          experience and the efforts of their lesser-known predecessors.
          Conventional wisdom also places great weight on insight in promoting
          breakthrough scientific achievements, as if ideas spontaneously pop
          into someone's head – fully formed and functional.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There may be some limited truth to this view. However, we believe that
          it largely misrepresents the real nature of scientific discovery, as
          well as that of creativity and innovation in many other realms of
          human endeavor.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Setting aside such greats as Darwin and Einstein – whose monumental
          contributions are duly celebrated – we suggest that innovation is more
          a process of trial and error, where two steps forward may sometimes
          come with one step back, as well as one or more stops to the right or
          left. This evolutionary view of human innovation undermines the notion
          of creative genius and recognizes the cumulative nature of scientific
          progress.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Consider one unheralded scientist: John Nicholson, a mathematical
          physicist working in the 1910s who postulated the existence of
          'proto-elements' in outer space. By combining different numbers of
          weights of these proto-elements' atoms, Nicholson could recover the
          weights of all the elements in the then-known periodic table. These
          successes are all the more noteworthy given the fact that Nicholson
          was wrong about the presence of proto-elements: they do not actually
          exist. Yet, amid his often fanciful theories and wild speculations,
          Nicholson also proposed a novel theory about the structure of atoms.
          Niels Bohr, the Nobel prize-winning father of modern atomic theory,
          jumped off from this interesting idea to conceive his now-famous model
          of the atom.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          What are we to make of this story? One might simply conclude that
          science is a collective and cumulative enterprise. That may be true,
          but there may be a deeper insight to be gleaned. We propose that
          science is constantly evolving, much as species of animals do. In
          biological systems, organisms may display new characteristics that
          result from random genetic mutations. In the same way, random,
          arbitrary or accidental mutations of ideas may help pave the way for
          advances in science. If mutations prove beneficial, then the animal or
          the scientific theory will continue to thrive and perhaps reproduce.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Support for this evolutionary view of behavioral innovation comes from
          many domains. Consider one example of an influential innovation in US
          horseracing. The so-called 'acey-deucy' stirrup placement, in which
          the rider's foot in his left stirrup is placed as much as 25
          centimeters lower than the right, is believed to confer important
          speed advantages when turning on oval tracks. It was developed by a
          relatively unknown jockey named Jackie Westrope. Had Westrope
          conducted methodical investigations or examined extensive film records
          in a shrewd plan to outrun his rivals? Had he foreseen the speed
          advantage that would be conferred by riding acey-deucy? No. He
          suffered a leg injury, which left him unable to fully bend his left
          knee. His modification just happened to coincide with enhanced
          left-hand turning performance. This led to the rapid and widespread
          adoption of riding acey-deucy by many riders, a racing style which
          continues in today's thoroughbred racing.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Plenty of other stories show that fresh advances can arise from error,
          misadventure, and also pure serendipity – a happy accident. For
          example, in the early 1970s, two employees of the company 3M each had
          a problem: Spencer Silver had a product – a glue which was only
          slightly sticky – and no use for it, while his colleague Art Fry was
          trying to figure out how to affix temporary bookmarks in his hymn book
          without damaging its pages. The solution to both these problems was
          invention of the brilliantly simple yet phenomenally successful
          Post-It note. Such examples give lie to the claim that ingenious,
          designing minds are responsible for human creativity and invention.
          Far more banal and mechanical forces may be at work; forces that are
          fundamentally connected to the laws of science.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The notions of insight, creativity and genius are often invoked, but
          they remain vague and of doubtful scientific utility, especially when
          one considers the diverse and enduring contributions of individuals
          such as Plato, Leonardo da Vinci, Shakespeare, Beethoven, Galileo,
          Newton, Kepler, Curie, Pasteur and Edison. These notions merely label
          rather than explain the evolution of human innovations. We need
          another approach, and there is a promising candidate.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Law of Effect was advanced by psychologist Edward Thorndike in
          1898, some 40 years after Charles Darwin published his groundbreaking
          work on biological evolution, <em>On the Origin of Species</em>. This
          simple law holds that organisms tend to repeat successful behaviors
          and to refrain from performing unsuccessful ones. Just like Darwin's
          Law of Natural Selection, the Law of Effect involves an entirely
          mechanical process of variation and selection, without any end
          objective in sight.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Of course, the origin of human innovation demands much further study.
          In particular, the provenance of the raw material on which the Law of
          Effect operates is not as clearly known as that of the genetic
          mutations on which the Law of Natural Selection operates. The
          generation of novel ideas and behaviors may not be entirely random,
          but constrained by prior successes and failures – of the current
          individual (such as Bohr) or of predecessors (such as Nicholson).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The time seems right for abandoning the naïve notion of intelligent
          design and genius, and for scientifically exploring the true origins
          of creative behavior.
