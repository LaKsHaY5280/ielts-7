          Materials to take us beyond concrete
        </h3>
        <p className="italic mb-4">
          Concrete is everywhere, but it's bad for the planet, generating large
          amounts of carbon dioxide – alternatives are being developed
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Concrete is the second most used substance in the global economy,
          after water – and one of the world's biggest single sources of
          greenhouse gas emissions. The chemical process by which cement, the
          key ingredient of concrete, is created results in large quantities of
          carbon dioxide. The UN estimates that there will be 9.8 billion people
          living on the planet by mid-century. They will need somewhere to live.
          If concrete is the only answer to the construction of new cities, then
          carbon emissions will soar, aggravating global warming. And so
          scientists have started innovating with other materials, in a scramble
          for alternatives to a universal commodity that has underpinned our
          modem life for many years.

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The problem with replacing concrete is that it is so very good at what
          it does. Chris Cheeseman, an engineering professor at Imperial College
          London, says the key thing to consider is the extent to which concrete
          is used around the world, and is likely to continue to be used.
          'Concrete is not a high-carbon product. Cement is high carbon, but
          concrete is not. But it is the scale on which it is used that makes it
          high carbon. The sheer scale of manufacture is so huge, that is the
          issue.'

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Not only are the ingredients of concrete relatively cheap and found in
          abundance in most places around the globe, the stuff itself has
          marvellous properties: Portland cement, the vital component of
          concrete, is mouldable and pourable, but quickly sets hard. Cheeseman
          also notes another advantage: concrete and steel have similar thermal
          expansion properties, so steel can be used to reinforce concrete,
          making it far stronger and more flexible as a building material than
          it could be on its own. According to Cheeseman, all these factors
          together make concrete hard to beat. 'Concrete is amazing stuff.
          Making anything with similar properties is going to be very
          difficult.'

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          A possible alternative to concrete is wood. Making buildings from wood
          may seem like a rather medieval idea, but climate change is driving
          architects to turn to treated timber as a possible resource. Recent
          years have seen the emergence of tall buildings constructed almost
          entirely from timber. Vancouver, Vienna and Brumunddal in Norway are
          all home to constructed tall, wooden buildings.

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Using wood to construct buildings, however, is not straightforward.
          Wood expands as it absorbs moisture from the air and is susceptible to
          pests, not to mention fire. But treating wood and combining it with
          other materials can improve its properties. Cross-laminated timber is
          engineered wood. An adhesive is used to stick layers of solid-sawn
          timber together, crosswise, to form building blocks. This material is
          light but has the strength of concrete and steel. Construction experts
          say that wooden buildings can be constructed at a greater speed than
          ones of concrete and steel and the process, it seems, is quieter.

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Stora Enso is Europe's biggest supplier of cross-laminated timber, and
          its vice-president Markus Mannstrom reports that the company is seeing
          increasing demand globally for building in wood, with climate change
          concerns the key driver. Finland, with its large forests, where Stora
          Enso is based, has been leading the way, but the company is seeing a
          rise in demand for its timber products across the world, including in
          Asia. Of course, using timber in a building also locks away the carbon
          that it absorbed as it grew. But even treated wood has its limitations
          and only when a wider range of construction projects has been proven
          in practice will it be possible to see wood as a real alternative to
          concrete in constructing tall buildings.

          Fly ash and slag from iron ore are possible alternatives to cement in
          a concrete mix. Fly ash, a byproduct of coal-burning power plants, can
          be incorporated into concrete mixes to make up as much as 15 to 30% of
          the cement, without harming the strength or durability of the
          resulting mix. Iron-ore slag, a byproduct of the iron-ore smelting
          process, can be used in a similar way. Their incorporation into
          concrete mixes has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          But Anna Surgenor, of the UK's Green Building Council, notes that
          although these waste products can save carbon in the concrete mix,
          their use is not always straightforward. 'It's possible to replace the
          cement content in concrete with waste products to lower the overall
          carbon impact. But there are several calculations that need to be
          considered across the entire life cycle of the building- these include
          factoring in where these materials are being shipped from. If they are
          transported over long distances, using fossil fuels, the use of
          alternative materials might not make sense from an overall carbon
          reduction perspective.'

          While these technologies are all promising ideas, they are either
          unproven or based on materials that are not abundant. In their
          overview of innovation in the concrete industry, Felix Preston and
          Johanna Lehne of the UK's Royal Institute of International Affairs
          reached the conclusion that, 'Some novel cements have been discussed
          for more than a decade within the research community, without breaking
          through. At present, these alternatives are rarely as cost-effective
          as conventional cement, and they face raw-material shortages and
          resistance from customers.'

          The successes and failures of the Doble brothers and their steam cars

          When primitive automobiles first began to appear in the 1800s, their
          engines were based on steam power. Steam had already enjoyed a long
          and successful career in the railways, so it was only natural that the
          technology evolved into a miniaturized version which was separate from
          the trains. But these early cars inherited steam's weaknesses along
          with its strengths. The boilers had to be lit by hand, and they
          required about twenty minutes to build up pressure before they could
          be driven. Furthermore, their water reservoirs only lasted for about
          thirty miles before needing replenishment. Despite such shortcomings,
          these newly designed self-propelled carriages offered quick
          transportation, and by the early 1900s it was not uncommon to see such
          machines shuttling wealthy citizens around town.

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          But the glory days of steam cars were few. A new technology called the
          Internal Combustion Engine soon appeared, which offered the ability to
          drive down the road just moments after starting up. At first, these
          noisy gasoline cars were unpopular because they were more complicated
          to operate and they had difficult hand-crank starters, which were
          known to break arms when the engines backfired. But in 1912 General
          Motors introduced the electric starter, and over the following few
          years steam power was gradually phased out.

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Even as the market was declining, four brothers made one last effort
          to rekindle the technology. Between 1906 and 1909, while still
          attending high school, Abner Doble and his three brothers built their
          first steam car in their parents' basement. It comprised parts taken
          from a wrecked early steam car but reconfigured to drive an engine of
          their own design. Though it did not run well, the Doble brothers went
          on to build a second and third prototype in the following years.
          Though the Doble boys' third prototype, nicknamed the Model B, still
          lacked the convenience of an internal combustion engine, it drew the
          attention of automobile trade magazines due to its numerous
          improvements over previous steam cars. The Model B proved to be
          superior to gasoline automobiles in many ways. Its high-pressure steam
          drove the engine pistons in virtual silence, in contrast to clattering
          gas engines which emitted the aroma of burned hydrocarbons. Perhaps
          most impressively, the Model B was amazingly swift. It could
          accelerate from zero to sixty miles per hour in just fifteen seconds,
          a feat described as 'remarkable acceleration' by <em>Automobile</em>{" "}
          magazine in 1914.

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The following year Abner Doble drove the Model B from Massachusetts to
          Detroit in order to seek investment in his automobile design, which he
          used to open the General Engineering Company. He and his brothers
          immediately began working on the Model C, which was intended to expand
          upon the innovations of the Model B. The brothers added features such
          as a key-based ignition in the cabin, eliminating the need for the
          operator to manually ignite the boiler. With these enhancements, the
          Dobles' new car company promised a steam vehicle which would provide
          all of the convenience of a gasoline car, but with much greater speed,
          much simpler driving controls, and a virtually silent powerplant. By
          the following April, the General Engineering Company had received
          5,390 deposits for Doble Detroits, which were scheduled for delivery
          in early 1918.

          Later that year Abner Doble delivered unhappy news to those eagerly
          awaiting the delivery of their modem new cars. Those buyers who
          received the handful of completed cars complained that the vehicles
          were sluggish and erratic, sometimes going in reverse when they should
          go forward. The new engine design, though innovative, was still
          plagued with serious glitches.

          The brothers made one final attempt to produce a viable steam
          automobile. In early 1924, the Doble brothers shipped a Model E to New
          York City to be road-tested by the Automobile Club of America. After
          sitting overnight in freezing temperatures, the car was pushed out
          into the road and left to sit for over an hour in the frosty morning
          air. At the turn of the key, the boiler lit and reached its operating
          pressure inside of forty seconds. As they drove the test vehicle
          further, they found that its evenly distributed weight lent it
          surprisingly good handling, even though it was so heavy. As the new
          Doble steamer was further developed and tested, its maximum speed was
          pushed to over a hundred miles per hour, and it achieved about fifteen
          miles per gallon of kerosene with negligible emissions.

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Sadly, the Dobles' brilliant steam car never was a financial success.
          Priced at around $18,000 in 1924, it was popular only among the very
          wealthy. Plus, it is said that no two Model Es were quite the same,
          because Abner Doble tinkered endlessly with the design. By the time
          the company folded in 1931, fewer than fifty of the amazing Model E
          steam cars had been produced. For his whole career, until his death in
          1961, Abner Doble remained adamant that steam-powered automobiles were
          at least equal to gasoline cars, if not superior. Given the evidence,
          he may have been right. Many of the Model E Dobles which have survived
          are still in good working condition, some having been driven over half
          a million miles with only normal maintenance. Astonishingly, an
          unmodified Doble Model E runs clean enough to pass the emissions laws
          in California today, and they are pretty strict. It is true that the
          technology poses some difficult problems, but you cannot help but
          wonder how efficient a steam car might be with the benefit of modem
          materials and computers. Under the current pressure to improve
          automotive performance and reduce emissions, it is not unthinkable
          that the steam car may rise again.

          The case for mixed-ability classes
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Picture this scene. It's an English literature lesson in a UK school,
          and the teacher has just read an extract from Shakespeare's{" "}
          <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> with a class of 15-year-olds. He's given
          some of the students copies of <em>No Fear Shakespeare</em>, a
          kid-friendly translation of the original. For three students, even
          these literacy demands are beyond them. Another girl simply can't
          focus and he gives her pens and paper to draw with. The teacher can
          ask the <em>No Fear</em> group to identify the key characters and
          maybe provide a tentative plot summary. He can ask most of the class
          about character development, and five of them might be able to support
          their statements with textual evidence. Now two curious students are
          wondering whether Shakespeare advocates living a life of moderation or
          one of passionate engagement.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          As a teacher myself, I'd think my lesson would be going rather well if
          the discussion went as described above. But wouldn't this kind of
          class work better if there weren't such a huge gap between the top and
          the bottom? If we put all the kids who needed literacy support into
          one class, and all the students who want to discuss the virtue of
          moderation into another?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The practice of 'streaming', or 'tracking', involves separating
          students into classes depending on their diagnosed levels of
          attainment. At a macro level, it requires the establishment of
          academically selective schools for the brightest students, and
          comprehensive schools for the rest. Within schools, it means selecting
          students into a 'stream' of general ability, or 'sets' of
          subject-specific ability. The practice is intuitively appealing to
          almost every stakeholder.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          I have heard the mixed-ability model attacked by way of analogy: a
          group hike. The fittest in the group take the lead and set a brisk
          pace, only to have to stop and wait every 20 minutes. This is
          frustrating, and their enthusiasm wanes. Meanwhile, the slowest ones
          are not only embarrassed but physically struggling to keep up. What's
          worse, they never get a long enough break. They honestly just want to
          quit. Hiking, they feel, is not for them.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Mixed-ability classes bore students, frustrate parents and bum out
          teachers. The brightest ones will never summit Mount Qomolangma, and
          the stragglers won't enjoy the lovely stroll in the park they are
          perhaps more suited to. Individuals suffer at the demands of the
          collective, mediocrity prevails. So: is learning like hiking?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The current pedagogical paradigm is arguably that of constructivism,
          which emerged out of the work of psychologist Lev Vygotsky. In the
          1930s, Vygotsky emphasised the importance of targeting a student's
          specific 'zone of proximal development' (ZPD). This is the gap between
          what they can achieve only with support – teachers, textbooks, worked
          examples, parents and so on – and what they can achieve independently.
          The purpose of teaching is to provide and then gradually remove this
          'scaffolding' until they are autonomous. If we accept this model, it
          follows that streaming students with similar ZPDs would be an
          efficient and effective solution. And that forcing everyone on the
          same hike – regardless of aptitude – would be madness.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Despite all this, there is limited empirical evidence to suggest that
          streaming results in better outcomes for students. Professor John
          Hattie, director of the Melbourne Education Research Institute, notes
          that 'tracking has minimal effects on learning outcomes'. What is
          more, streaming appears to significantly – and negatively – affect
          those students assigned to the lowest sets. These students tend to
          have much higher representation of low socioeconomic class. Less
          significant is the small benefit for those lucky clever students in
          the higher sets. The overall result is that the smart stay smart and
          the dumb get dumber, further entrenching the social divide.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          In the latest update of Hattie's influential meta-analysis of factors
          influencing student achievement, one of the most significant factors
          is the teachers' estimate of achievement. Streaming students by
          diagnosed achievement automatically limits what the teacher feels the
          student is capable of. Meanwhile, in a mixed environment, teachers'
          estimates need to be more diverse and flexible.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          While streaming might seem to help teachers effectively target a
          student's ZPD, it can underestimate the importance of peer-to-peer
          learning. A crucial aspect of constructivist theory is the role of the
          MKO – 'more knowledgeable other' – in knowledge construction. While
          teachers are traditionally the MKOs in classrooms, the value of
          knowledgeable student peers must not go unrecognised either.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          I find it amazing to watch students get over an idea to their peers in
          ways that I would never think of. They operate with different language
          tools and different social tools from teachers and, having just learnt
          it themselves, they possess similar cognitive structures to their
          struggling classmates. There is also something exciting about passing
          on skills and knowledge that you yourself have only just mastered – a
          certain pride and zeal, a certain freshness to the interaction between
          'teacher' and 'learner' that is often lost by the expert for whom the
          steps are obvious and the joy of discovery forgotten.

          Having a variety of different abilities in a collaborative learning
          environment provides valuable resources for helping students meet
          their learning needs, not to mention improving their communication and
          social skills. And today, more than ever, we need the many to flourish
          – not suffer at the expense of a few bright stars. Once a year, I go
          on a hike with my class, a mixed bunch of students. It is challenging.
          The fittest students realise they need to encourage the reluctant.
          There are lookouts who report back, and extra items to carry for
          others. We make it – together.
