              This well-known campsite in the wild near Browbourne is a winner
              with campers who are looking for time out from their fast-paced
              jobs in the capital. Despite its limited facilities, the site,
              with its large tent pitches, is an ideal base for exploring the
              area and driving to the rock museum, the craft workshops or Gaydon
              Castle. Just follow the signs.

              This campsite looks like it's going to be a winner. It only opened
              last year, but already the website has some very positive reviews
              from the handful of campers who know about it so far. It offers
              splendid views over some of the country's most attractive beaches,
              which can be accessed by steep, narrow cliff steps. You need a
              good level of fitness for these, and don't forget to leave some
              energy for the return trip at the end of the day.

              You won't be disappointed when you reach Oakerly, despite the
              problems of getting there by car on such narrow roads. You'll see
              quite a lot of motorhomes when you hit the clifftop, but there's
              still plenty of room for tents on the spacious lawn that also
              offers a camp kitchen, restaurant and bar. Make sure you stay safe
              and pitch your tent within the white line around the cliff edge,
              though.

              The emphasis at this site is on back-to-basics camping. It's
              advisable to come in a group as there are few facilities and you
              need to do all your own cooking. The area is rather exposed, and
              in periods of bad weather it can't be reached at all so check on
              the website before you go.

              The 20-metre high rockfaces that surround this site are especially
              attractive to rock climbers, who come here to camp from hundreds

              with success, according to the website! It's not compulsory, of
              course, and there are plenty of other activities for campers to
              get involved in, such as birdwatching and bathing in the sea.

        <div className="mb-8">
          <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">A day in the life of a care worker</h3>
          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            Care workers in Britain provide elderly and disabled people with the
            opportunity to remain independent at home, rather than moving into a
            care home. For those interested in the work, here is what a typical
            day could be like for a trained care worker.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            Care workers often start early, as the first client of the day may
            need help getting out of bed and putting on their clothes; they may
            suffer from a condition that prevents them from doing this easily.
            Providing these services helps clients to look and feel as good as
            possible when beginning their day. The care worker may then help to
            cook breakfast for the client, and this is often a good time to
            enjoy a conversation and catch up on how they are feeling. Many
            clients appreciate being able to chat to someone regularly, as some
            may have no family members or friends living nearby. Next, the care
            worker may take the opportunity to do some basic housework for the
            client. Housework is often something that elderly people or people
            with disabilities may not be able to do themselves. Even something
            as simple as hoovering the living room can make a huge difference to
            a client's day. Of course, there may be the breakfast dishes to do
            as well.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            Later in the morning, the care worker may move on to another client
            in order to help them prepare their midday meal. Care workers try to
            ensure this is healthy because it is so important to keep clients
            fit and well. When that's finished, the care worker may help the
            client to carry out their shopping by going with them to the local
            supermarket.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            During the afternoon, a care worker may help a third client with an
            outdoor activity, which could involve going for a short walk in the
            local area or taking the laundry to the launderette. Elderly people
            may not feel confident going far on their own, so having company can
            be a great help.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify">
            The care worker may participate in cooking dinner with their last
            client and, before going home, they may also get out their client's
            medication. This ensures the client remembers to take it before
            going to bed.

            How to find a good balance between your work and your personal life
          </h3>
          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            A good work-life balance is beneficial to everyone. But how can it
            be achieved? The first step is to take a serious look at the amount
            of time you are devoting to work and set about reducing it. The main
            benefit most people notice once they stop working too much is an
            improvement in their general health and wellbeing.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-bold">Tips for a healthy work-life balance</h4>
          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            A recent study showed office workers spend approximately 1,700 hours
            a year in front of a computer. Ensure that your workstation is set
            up so you're as comfortable as possible and this will help to
            minimise the chance of any injuries.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            Whether it's making a hot drink, going for a walk or simply chatting
            with a colleague, regular breaks are vital. Your brain needs a break
            roughly every 90 minutes or concentration declines, leaving you with
            difficulty focusing and feeling sleepy.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            Setting goals for both your professional and personal life is great.
            Remember though, to make these realistic, because setting an
            unattainable goal is the quickest way to damage your confidence.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            Activities such as sports and gymnastics are known to decrease
            tension and increase endurance, two important factors towards
            achieving a healthy work-life balance. They also boost your belief
            that you can do whatever you are faced with.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            Sometimes it's easier said than done, but if you're juggling
            numerous pieces of work on a daily basis, learning to prioritise is
            key. Try to break down your work into various categories, depending
            on how urgent and important each piece of work is. This will help
            you to plan your day and achieve more.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            Ensure you have time to do the things that make you happy. If you've
            got nothing nice to look forward to and can only see a long line of
            work days ahead of you, this can easily become overwhelming and
            ultimately hinder your productivity.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            It's there for a reason and there are no prizes for giving it up, so
            make sure you take your annual holiday entitlement. You don't have
            to be going on an exotic foreign trip – maybe you just fancy a rest
            day watching films or you want to take some time off to spend with a
            friend you don't see enough.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify">
            Family, friends and favourite pets are the ultimate life enhancers.
            From evenings out to simply taking a walk in the sunshine, spending
            time with the ones you love is the best way to unwind fully and feel
            the effects of a good work-life balance.

            City's 'Henry' programme gives children choices while helping
            parents stay in the driving seat
          </h3>
          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            Leeds has become the first city in the UK to report a drop in
            childhood obesity after introducing a programme called 'Henry' to
            help parents set boundaries for their children and put them off
            sweets and junk food. Only a few cities in the world, notably
            Amsterdam, have managed to cut child obesity. As in Amsterdam, the
            decline in Leeds is most marked among families living in the most
            deprived areas, where the problem is worst and hardest to tackle.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            'The improvement in the most deprived children in Leeds is
            startling,' said Susan Jebb, a professor of diet and population
            health at Oxford University, whose team has analysed the city's
            data. Over four years, obesity has dropped from 11.5% to 10.5% and
            the trajectory is steadily downwards. Among the more affluent
            families, there was also a decline from 6.8% to 6%. Overall the drop
            was from 9.4% to 8.8%. The data comes from the national child
            measurement programme (NCMP), which requires all children to be
            weighed at the start and end of primary school. The biggest decline
            in obesity in Leeds is 6.4% in the reception class, at about the age
            of four.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            No such data has been reported elsewhere in the UK, where childhood
            obesity is a major concern. The measurement programme shares the
            progress made in each city with those considered comparable. For
            Leeds, the 15 closest 'neighbours' at the start of its study period
            in 2009 were Sheffield, Kirklees, Bristol, Newcastle upon Tyne,
            Coventry, Bolton, Wakefield, Derby, Bradford, Dudley, Medway,
            Liverpool, Swindon, County Durham and Warrington. The obesity rates
            there and across the country have not shifted. Susan Jebb added that
            the dropping rate in Leeds appeared to be a trend. 'This is four
            years, not one rogue data point,' she said at the European Congress
            on Obesity in Glasgow where she presented the research.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            Jebb, a former government adviser, says they cannot be sure what has
            turned the tide in Leeds – but it could involve a programme called
            'Henry' that the city introduced as the core of its obesity strategy
            in 2009, focusing particularly on the youngest children and poorest
            families. 'Henry' (Health, Exercise, Nutrition for the Really Young)
            supports parents in setting boundaries for their children and taking
            a positive stance on issues from healthy eating to bedtimes.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            'Henry's' chief executive, Kim Roberts, said the drop in obesity in
            Leeds was 'unprecedented … The indicators are that this isn't
            happening in other cities'. The programme encourages authoritative
            rather than authoritarian parenting, she said. 'Authoritarian
            parenting is when children are told what to eat and what to do, such
            as being banned from leaving the table until they have eaten their
            sprouts,' said Roberts. 'Permissive parenting is asking children
            what they want to do. But 'Henry' encourages a third approach known
            as authoritative parenting, where parents make it clear they are in
            charge, but also respond to their children.' Instead of being asked
            what vegetable they want with dinner, children might be asked
            whether they would like carrots or broccoli. Instead of being told
            to go to bed, they are asked where they want to read their story
            beforehand.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            Lisa, who joined a 'Henry' parenting course when her oldest daughter
            was two, is enthusiastic about her family's experience of the
            programme. She learned a lot about healthy eating, saved money by
            planning meals and lost two stone herself. 'I think it made me a
            better parent because of all the parenting skills stuff. I was able
            to share some of the ideas with my partner and as a result the kids
            became calmer and happier, which helped us feel less stressed too,'
            she said.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
            Janice Burberry, the head of public health at Leeds city council,
            said the early years were a good time to intervene to support
            families. 'Parents want to do the best for their children,' she
            said. 'We wanted to focus on prevention because it's very, very
            difficult when obesity has taken hold to tackle it. We understand
            that there is no magic bullet here. Parents are experts in their own
            lives, and they know what they can and can't achieve. The strategy
            of 'Henry' is about sitting alongside parents and thinking through
            what's right for them.'
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify">
            The public health minister, Seema Kennedy, was enthusiastic. 'There
            are some fantastic pockets of work happening in early years already,
            and while still in the early phases, it is encouraging to see what
            can be achieved locally through interventions like this,' she said.
            'I know how hard it can be for busy parents to make healthy choices
            for their families, so anything that can make it easier is a real
            lifeline.'
