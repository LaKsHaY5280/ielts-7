          Archaeologists discover evidence of prehistoric island settlers
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          In early April 2019, Dr Ceri Shipton and his colleagues from
          Australian National University became the first archaeologists to
          explore Obi, one of many tropical islands in Indonesia's Maluku Utara
          province. The research team's discoveries suggest that the prehistoric
          people who lived on Obi were adept on both land and sea, hunting in
          the dense rainforest, foraging on the seashore, and possibly even
          voyaging between islands.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The excavations were part of a project to learn more about how people
          first dispersed from mainland Asia, through the Indonesian archipelago
          and into the prehistoric continent that once connected Australia and
          New Guinea. The team's earlier research suggested that the
          northernmost islands in the group, known as the Wallacean islands,
          including Obi, would have offered the easiest migration route. It also
          seemed likely that these islands were crucial 'stepping stones' on
          humans' island-hopping voyages through this region millennia ago. But
          to support this idea, they needed archaeological evidence for humans
          living in this remote area in the ancient past. So, they travelled to
          Obi to look for sites that might reveal evidence of early occupation.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Just inland from the village of Kelo on Obi's northern coast, Shipton
          and his colleagues found two caves containing prehistoric rock
          shelters that were suitable for excavation. With the permission and
          help of the local people of Kelo, they dug a small test excavation in
          each shelter. There they found numerous artefacts, including fragments
          of axes, some dating to about 14,000 years ago. The earliest axes at
          Kelo were made using clam shells. Axes made from clam shells from
          roughly the same time had also previously been found elsewhere in this
          region, including on the nearby island of Gebe to the northeast. As on
          Gebe, it is highly likely that Obi's axes were used in the
          construction of canoes, thus allowing these early peoples to maintain
          connections between communities on neighbouring islands.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The oldest cultural layers from the Kelo site provided the team with
          the earliest record for human occupation on Obi, dating back around
          18,000 years. At this time the climate was drier and colder than
          today, and the island's dense rainforests would likely have been much
          less impenetrable than they are now. Sea levels were about 120 metres
          lower, meaning Obi was a much larger island, encompassing what is
          today the separate island of Bisa, as well as several other small
          islands nearby.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Roughly 11,700 years ago, as the most recent ice age ended, the
          climate became significantly warmer and wetter, no doubt making Obi's
          jungle much thicker. According to the researchers, it is no
          coincidence that around this time the first axes crafted from stone
          rather than sea shells appear, likely in response to their heavy-duty
          use for clearing and modification of the increasingly dense
          rainforest. While stone takes about twice as long to grind into an axe
          compared to shell, the harder material keeps its sharp edge for
          longer.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Judging by the bones which the researchers unearthed in the Kelo
          caves, people living there mainly hunted the Rothschild's cuscus, a
          possum-like creature that still lives on Obi today. As the forest grew
          more dense, people probably used axes to clear patches of forest and
          make hunting easier.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Shipton's team's excavation of the shelters at the Kelo site unearthed
          a volcanic glass substance called obsidian, which must have been
          brought over from another island, as there is no known source on Obi.
          It also revealed particular types of beads, similar to those
          previously found on islands in southern Wallacea. These finds again
          support the idea that Obi islanders routinely travelled to other
          islands.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The excavations suggest people successfully lived in the two Kelo
          shelters for about 10,000 years. But then, about 8,000 years ago, both
          were abandoned. Did the residents leave Obi completely, or move
          elsewhere on the island? Perhaps the jungle had grown so thick that
          axes were no longer a match for the dense undergrowth. Perhaps people
          simply moved to the coast and turned to fishing rather than hunting as
          a means of survival.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Whatever the reason for the departure, there is no evidence for use of
          the Kelo shelters after this time, until about 1,000 years ago, when
          they were re-occupied by people who owned pottery as well as items
          made out of gold and silver. It seems likely, in view of Obi's
          location, that this final phase of occupation also saw the Kelo
          shelters used by people involved in the historic trade in spices
          between the Maluku islands and the rest of the world.

        <p className="mb-4">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based
          on Reading Passage 2 below.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-center">
          The global importance of wetlands
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>A</strong> Wetlands are areas where water covers the soil, or
          is present either at or near the surface of the soil, for all or part
          of the year. These are complex ecosystems, rich in unique plant and
          animal life. But according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWFN),
          half of the world's wetlands have disappeared since 1990 – converted
          or destroyed for commercial development, drainage schemes and the
          extraction of minerals and peat". Many of those that remain have been
          damaged by agricultural pesticides and fertilisers, industrial
          pollutants, and construction works.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>B</strong> Throughout history, humans have gathered around
          wetlands, and their fertile ecosystems have played an important part
          in human development. Consequently, they are of considerable
          religious, historical and archaeological value to many communities
          around the world. 'Wetlands directly support the livelihoods and
          well-being of millions of people,' says Dr Matthew McCartney,
          principal researcher and hydrologist at the International Water
          Management Institute (IWMI). 'In many developing countries, large
          numbers of people are dependent on wetland agriculture for their
          livelihoods.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>C</strong> They also serve a crucial environmental purpose.
          'Wetlands are one of the key tools in mitigating climate change across
          the planet,' says Pieter van Eijk, head of Climate Adaptation at
          Wetlands International (WI), pointing to their use as buffers that
          protect coastal areas from sea-level rise and extreme weather events
          such as hurricanes and flooding. Wetland coastal forests provide food
          and water, as well as shelter from storms, and WI and other agencies
          are working to restore those forests which have been lost. 'It can be
          as simple as planting a few trees per hectare to create shade and
          substantially change a microclimate,' he says. 'Implementing climate
          change projects isn't so much about money.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>D</strong> The world's wetlands are, unfortunately, rich
          sources for in-demand commodities, such as palm oil and pulpwood.
          Peatlands – wetlands with a waterlogged organic soil layer – are
          particularly targeted. When peatlands are drained for cultivation,
          they become net carbon emitters instead of active carbon stores, and,
          according to Marcel Silvius, head of Climate smart Land-use at WI,
          this practice causes six per cent of all global carbon emissions. The
          clearance of peatlands for planting also increases the risk of forest
          fires, which release huge amounts of CO2. 'We're seeing huge peatland
          forests with extremely high biodiversity value being lost for a few
          decades of oil palm revenues,' says Silvius.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>E</strong> The damage starts when logging companies arrive to
          clear the trees. They dig ditches to enter the peat swamps by boat and
          then float the logs out the same way. These are then used to drain
          water out of the peatlands to allow for the planting of corn, oil
          palms or pulpwood trees. Once the water has drained away, bacteria and
          fungi then break down the carbon in the peat and turn it into CO2 and
          methane. Meanwhile, the remainder of the solid matter in the peat
          starts to move downwards, in a process known as subsidence*. Peat
          comprises 90 per cent water, so this is one of the most alarming
          consequences of peatland clearances. 'In the tropics, peat subsides at
          about four centimetres a year, so within half a century, very large
          landscapes on Sumatra and Borneo will become flooded as the peat drops
          below water level,' says Silvius. 'It's a huge catastrophe that's in
          preparation. Some provinces will lose 40 per cent of their landmass.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>F</strong> And while these industries affect wetlands in ways
          that can easily be documented, Dr Dave Tickner of the WWFN believes
          that more subtle impacts can be even more devastating. 'Sediment
          run-off and fertilisers can be pretty invisible,' says Tickner.
          'Over-extraction of water is equally invisible. You do get shock
          stories about rivers running red, or even catching fire, but there's
          seldom one big impact that really hurts a wetland.' Tickner does not
          blame anyone for deliberate damage, however. 'I've worked on wetland
          issues for 20 years and have never met anybody who wanted to damage a
          wetland,' he says. 'It isn't something that people generally set out
          to do. Quite often, the effects simply come from people trying to make
          a living.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>G</strong> Silvius also acknowledges the importance of income
          generation. 'It's not that we just want to restore the biodiversity of
          wetlands – which we do – but we recognise there's a need to provide an
          income for local people.' This approach is supported by IWMI. 'The
          idea is that people in a developing country will only protect wetlands
          if they value and profit from them,' says McCartney. 'For
          sustainability, it's essential that local people are involved in
          wetland planning and decision making and have clear rights to use
          wetlands.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>H</strong> The fortunes of wetlands would be improved, Silvius
          suggests, if more governments recognised their long-term value.
          'Different governments have different attitudes,' he says, and goes on
          to explain that some countries place a high priority on restoring
          wetlands, while others still deny the issue. McCartney is cautiously
          optimistic, however. 'Awareness of the importance of wetlands is
          growing,' he says. 'It's true that wetland degradation still continues
          at a rapid pace, but my impression is that things are slowly
          changing.'

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-center">
          Is the era of artificial speech translation upon us?
        </h3>
        <p className="italic text-center mb-4">
          Once the stuff of science fiction, technology that enables people to
          talk using different languages is now here. But how effective is it?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Noise, Alex Waibel tells me, is one of the major challenges that
          artificial speech translation has to meet. A device may be able to
          recognise speech in a laboratory, or a meeting room, but will struggle
          to cope with the kind of background noise I can hear in my office
          surrounding Professor Waibel as he speaks to me from Kyoto station in
          Japan. I'm struggling to follow him in English, on a scratchy line
          that reminds me we are nearly 10,000 kilometres apart – and that
          distance is still an obstacle to communication even if you're speaking
          the same language, as we are. We haven't reached the future yet. If we
          had, Waibel would have been able to speak more comfortably in his
          native German and I would have been able to hear his words in English.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          At Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where he is a professor of
          computer science, Waibel and his colleagues already give lectures in
          German that their students can follow in English via an electronic
          translator. The system generates text that students can read on their
          laptops or phones, so the process is somewhat similar to subtitling.
          It helps that lecturers speak clearly, don't have to compete with
          background chatter, and say much the same thing each year.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The idea of artificial speech translation has been around for a long
          time. Douglas Adams' science fiction novel, The Hitchhiker's Guide to
          the Galaxy, published in 1979, featured a life form called the 'Babel
          fish' which, when placed in the ear, enabled a listener to understand
          any language in the universe. It came to represent one of those
          devices that technology enthusiasts dream of long before they become
          practically realisable, like TVs flat enough to hang on walls: objects
          that we once could only dream of having but that are now commonplace.
          Now devices that look like prototype Babel fish have started to
          appear, riding a wave of advances in artificial translation and voice
          recognition.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          At this stage, however, they seem to be regarded as eye-catching
          novelties rather than steps towards what Waibel calls 'making a
          language-transparent society'. They tend to be domestic devices or
          applications suitable for hotel check-ins, for example, providing a
          practical alternative to speaking traveller's English. The efficiency
          of the translator is less important than the social function. However,
          'Professionals are less inclined to be patient in a conversation,'
          founder and CEO at Waverly Labs, Andrew Ochoa, observes. To redress
          this, Waverly is now preparing a new model for professional
          applications, which entails performance improvements in speech
          recognition, translation accuracy and the time it takes to deliver the
          translated speech.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          For a conversation, both speakers need to have devices called Pilots
          (translator earpieces) in their ears. 'We find that there's a barrier
          with sharing one of the earphones with a stranger,' says Ochoa. That
          can't have been totally unexpected. The problem would be solved if
          earpiece translators became sufficiently prevalent that strangers
          would be likely to already have their own in their ears. Whether that
          happens, and how quickly, will probably depend not so much on the
          earpieces themselves, but on the prevalence of voice-controlled
          devices and artificial translation in general.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Waibel highlights the significance of certain Asian nations, noting
          that voice translation has really taken off in countries such as Japan
          with a range of systems. There is still a long way to go, though. A
          translation system needs to be simultaneous, like the translator's
          voice speaking over the foreign politician being interviewed on the
          TV, rather than in sections that oblige speakers to pause after every
          few remarks and wait for the translation to be delivered. It needs to
          work offline, for situations where internet access isn't possible, and
          to address apprehensions about the amount of private speech data
          accumulating in the cloud, having been sent to servers for processing.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Systems not only need to cope with physical challenges such as noise,
          they will also need to be socially aware by addressing people in the
          right way. Some cultural traditions demand solemn respect for academic
          status, for example, and it is only polite to respect this.
          Etiquette-sensitive artificial translators could relieve people of the
          need to know these differing cultural norms. At the same time, they
          might help to preserve local customs, slowing the spread of habits
          associated with international English, such as its readiness to get on
          first-name terms.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Professors and other professionals will not outsource language
          awareness to software, though. If the technology matures into
          seamless, ubiquitous artificial speech translation, it will actually
          add value to language skills. Whether it will help people conduct
          their family lives or relationships is open to question – though one
          noteworthy possibility is that it could overcome the language barriers
          that often arise between generations after migration, leaving children
          and their grandparents without a shared language.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Whatever uses it is put to, though, it will never be as good as the
          real thing. Even if voice morphing technology simulates the speaker's
          voice, their lip movements won't match, and they will look like they
          are in a dubbed movie. The contrast will underline the value of shared
          languages, and the value of learning them. Sharing a language can
          promote a sense of belonging and community, as with the international
          scientists who use English as a lingua franca, where their
          predecessors used Latin. Though the practical need for a common
          language will diminish, the social value of sharing one will persist.
          And software will never be a substitute for the subtle but vital
          understanding that comes with knowledge of a language.
