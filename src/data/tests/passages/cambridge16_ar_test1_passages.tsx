        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">Stepwells</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Unique to the region, stepwells are wells in which the water can be
          reached by descending a set of steps. They lent themselves to the
          aesthetics of Persian architecture and were often built with
          decorative elements.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Throughout the arid regions of India, step-wells have been fundamental
          in providing communities with a water source for drinking, bathing,
          irrigation and washing. Although it is said that stepwells date back
          to around 550 AD, the earliest example found is the Stepping Well of
          Asar dating from the 13th century.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Built from stone and maintained with steps leading down to the water
          source, stepwells – known locally as baolis, baoris or vavs – are
          often architecturally complex and vary widely in size and shape. The
          stepwells were constructed to last for centuries, and even today many
          of them still retain water after a millennium of use. In spite of
          their ancient history and widespread existence, most stepwells were
          gradually abandoned and eventually became neglected.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The journalist Victoria Lautman has spent years traveling through
          India to document these historically significant and disappearing
          structures. Her collection of images is arguably the most
          comprehensive visual repository of stepwells to date. While conducting
          research in India, Lautman visited more than 120 sites in seven
          states.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Lautman told The Times of India: "Little was known about stepwells and
          I became a bit obsessed with figuring out what they looked like and
          where they existed." She continues, "all I knew was that they were
          subterranean water-harvesting structures, some as old as the 2nd
          century." With over 2,000 stepwells across India, some of the most
          famous are in Delhi, which is home to almost 30, though many are in a
          dilapidated state.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Stepwells were built with steps to make it easier to access water
          throughout the year. As the water level drops, the stairs will still
          reach down to the water. At the same time, they were an escape from
          the sweltering Indian summer, when temperatures can reach in excess of
          45 degrees. The cool interior of the wells would sometimes have been
          as many as five stories below ground level, making them the perfect
          place to pause, rest and socialise.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Lautman argues that the cultural and religious significance of
          stepwells should not be understated. "Stepwells were a way for the
          elite to give back to the community, so they were generally financed
          by wealthy landlords, or royalty." They were dedicated by wealthy
          women as a gift to the community and many have been built in honour of
          kings or deities. Stepwells were also locations where locals could
          meet and women could escape their households to socialise.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          However, the arrival in India of the British Empire saw the beginning
          of the end for stepwells. The British were afraid of the hygiene of
          these water sources and feared they could breed disease: the water was
          often dirty and mosquitoes bred there, which spread malaria. And
          later, when modern water systems were introduced, reaching for a tap
          was a lot easier than climbing down dozens of steps.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Nowadays, following years of neglect, many stepwells have been reduced
          to garbage dumps, filled with sewage or debris, and have gone
          completely dry. In an article for Slate magazine entitled "Why Have So
          Many of India's Beautiful Stepwells Been Left To Perish?", Lautman
          says: "it's very much out of sight out of mind. Until recently, few
          Indians had ever heard of them, or they were also called bowdies,
          baolis, vavs, veers, or something else."
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          While India's stepwells continue to vanish, a few of them are still
          used daily and even receive government maintenance. The states of
          Gujarat and Rajasthan are home to some of the oldest and largest
          examples, and are leading the effort to preserve these magnificent
          structures. Locals soak in the waters of Gujarat's 15th-century
          Rudabai Vav, while the same state's 11th-century Rani Ki Vav has been
          listed as a Unesco World Heritage Site.

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 14-26</strong>,
          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">The concept of intelligence</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Looked at in one way, everyone knows what intelligence is; looked at
          in another way, no one does. In other words, people all have
          unconscious notions – known as 'implicit theories' – of intelligence,
          but no one knows for certain what it actually is. This chapter
          addresses how people conceptualize intelligence, whatever it may
          actually be.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But why should we even care what people think intelligence is, as
          opposed to valuing what it actually is? There are several reasons
          people's conceptions of intelligence matter.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          First, implicit theories of intelligence drive the way in which people
          perceive and evaluate their own intelligence and that of others.
          Consider, for example, a person who believes that intelligence is what
          you know – that it is the amount of knowledge you have. That person
          might value having children memorize capitals, states, countries, and
          the like. The person might even favor a curriculum that emphasizes
          such memorization, and standardized tests that measure how much
          knowledge students have accumulated. In fact, a substantial part of
          the audience for commercial knowledge-based game shows such as
          Jeopardy! might implicitly believe, at some level, that intelligence
          is largely knowledge.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          A teacher who believes that intelligence is what you know (knowledge)
          and how quickly and accurately you can process it, will teach and test
          differently from a teacher who believes that intelligence is how
          creatively you can use knowledge, such as how well you can use the
          knowledge to come up with new ideas. The latter teacher may value
          curiosity and imagination more than the former teacher. Whether
          intelligence really is all of these things (and probably it is to some
          extent) is less important than what people believe it is, because they
          will act in ways that reflect those beliefs.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Second, the emphasis placed on intelligence appears to vary across
          cultures. For example, Taiwanese parents tend to place more emphasis
          on their children's academic performance than do their counterparts in
          the US, and academic performance depends in large part on intellectual
          performance. Because cultures may define intelligence differently,
          cross-cultural psychologists need to know what people in different
          cultures actually believe intelligence to be. Once we know in what
          ways conceptions are similar and in what ways they are different, we
          can better compare those portions of intelligence that appear to be
          common across cultures.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Third, people's implicit theories of intelligence may reveal important
          keys to understanding the nature of human intelligence. Scientists'
          explicit theories – the formal ones proposed and tested by
          psychologists – may be useful in illuminating the nature of
          intelligence as a scientific concept. But a complete understanding of
          intelligence must also take into account people's implicit theories –
          their conceptions of what intelligence is. For example, some
          psychologists emphasize the role of both speed of mental processing
          and knowledge in intellectual functioning. Others disagree, or at
          least have different emphases.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There is a much wider range of implicit theories of intelligence
          across people and cultures than there is in our explicit (scientific)
          theories of intelligence. For example, some people believe
          intelligence to be entirely a matter of book learning, whereas others
          see it more as 'street smarts'. Still others may believe intelligence
          to be a matter of being able to adapt to one's environment, or of
          being socially competent.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          For example, research has shown that Westerners – for example,
          Americans – tend to view intelligence as a means for individuals to
          devise categories and to engage in rational debate, while people in
          some Eastern cultures – for example, some Chinese and Japanese – tend
          to view intelligence as a way for members of a community to recognize
          contradiction and complexity and to play their social roles
          successfully. In Western cultures, intelligence tends to be viewed as
          inherent in the person and as independent of the surrounding context.
          In some Eastern cultures, it tends to be viewed as more holistic and
          as deriving from the relationship between a person and the surrounding
          context.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          These differences have important consequences. For instance, when
          intelligence is viewed as a key to success, its emphasis by a parent
          can lead either to achievement or to failure. A parent who thinks that
          doing well depends on intelligence, and that intelligence is mostly
          fixed, is likely to concentrate on how well her children perform in
          school – say on spelling tests – rather than on how hard they work in
          order to learn to spell. She might say, 'You got an A in spelling!
          You're so smart!' The trouble is that the child may come to believe
          that doing well is a matter of having intelligence and doing poorly is
          a matter of not having it. When the child eventually does poorly on
          some test, as will happen sooner or later, she may decide that she is
          not smart after all, and give up. In other words, the parent's
          well-meaning comment can create what psychologist Carol Dweck refers
          to as a 'fixed' mindset toward intelligence.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          A parent who emphasizes the role of effort in doing well is more
          likely to promote the development of what Dweck calls a 'growth'
          mindset. In this case, the parent might say, 'You got an A in
          spelling! That's great! You must have worked very hard at it!' When
          the child later does encounter a failure, she will be less likely to
          view the failure as reflecting on her intellectual ability than on her
          effort.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In sum, implicit theories can make a big difference in people's lives.
          Parents' implicit theories of intelligence matter because they
          determine the kinds of messages they send to their children. If they
          believe intelligence is fixed, they are more likely to send messages
          about ability; if they believe intelligence is acquirable through
          effort, they are more likely to send messages about effort. What
          messages a parent sends may make a big difference in the mindset the
          children ultimately adopt toward their own intelligence.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4">READING PASSAGE 3</h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>,
          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">How we take ownership of objects</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          It's mine! The psychology of ownership starts at a young age.
          Psychologists Ori and Rom Brafman write about a well-known experiment
          where the baby of one mother is placed with the baby of another, then
          the mothers are told to retrieve their children. The children start
          screaming and protesting as they are retrieved – they've been given to
          the wrong mothers.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Brafmans note that the babies are wearing diaper pins (the
          experiment was conducted in the 1960s, before disposable nappies), and
          the mothers have been switched around. But the mothers don't notice
          the wrong pins; they only see their infant is in another woman's arms.
          Eventually they stop and realize they don't have their child. While
          that doesn't demonstrate the baby's sense of attachment, it does show
          a thought process that has its roots in ownership.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Psychology professor Bruce Hood says that our possessive feelings
          toward objects start at about age two. You don't explain to a toddler
          that it is rude to grab a toy away from another child by using
          abstract concepts of ownership. They already seem to understand what
          it means that a toy belongs to them. Hood explored this by conducting
          an experiment in which a copying machine was introduced to three-to
          six-year-olds. They were shown that it could make exact physical
          copies of any object. A child's favourite toy was then put into the
          machine, and the researcher secretly swapped it with a copy that had
          been made earlier. When the tray opened, almost all the children
          wanted their original toy, not the copy that was identical in every
          way, because of their special attachment to it.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The feeling of ownership is deeply embedded within us and emerges
          during our most basic psychological processes. Research has found that
          when people are randomly assigned objects, they quickly develop an
          irrational attachment to them. In one study, participants were
          separated into buyers and sellers and given the opportunity to buy and
          sell coffee mugs. The sellers wanted a higher price for the mugs than
          the buyers were willing to pay. The simple fact of being told they
          owned the mug made them value it more highly.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          This preference for an object you've been given is called the
          'endowment effect'. People who are given a piece of chocolate and the
          option to switch it for another flavour usually won't. Another
          example: US basketball fans were asked to choose randomly from several
          posters and take the one they'd chosen; most refused to exchange their
          poster for a different one two minutes later.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Our sense of ownership, then, is attached to things we feel we own.
          This concept of ownership is psychological, but can be independent of
          legal ownership. For example, you might have a strong sense of 'this
          is my office' at work, even though the company legally owns it. The
          Brafmans note that 'borders, both physical and psychological, have a
          profound effect on our sense of ownership'. On the physical side,
          anything you set off, enclose, or otherwise create a border around
          feels more like yours.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Consider the word 'homeland', used in politics. It implies that the
          country is like a home, that 'the people of the homeland' own it, and
          that comparing it to a home is an appropriate metaphor. We can think
          of a country as something we own, because it has clearly defined
          borders.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The social psychologist Leon Festinger demonstrated the connection
          between the effort we put into creating or acquiring something and our
          psychological ownership of it. In one experiment, his subjects had to
          solve difficult puzzles to be admitted to a group. They were told the
          group would be discussing an interesting topic or a boring topic. It
          turned out that the ones who solved puzzles to get into the boring
          discussion rated the group as more attractive than those who got into
          it without solving puzzles. The harder it is to get into or achieve
          something, the more you'll value and feel attached to it – a kind of
          psychological ownership.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In 2010, psychologists Michael Norton, Daniel Mochon and Dan Ariely
          studied the effect of putting effort into objects. In their
          experiment, one group of people folded origami animals (a frog or
          crane) and another group were just shown the animals. The ones who did
          the folding were asked how much they'd pay for the object, and they
          offered an amount five times the amount offered by the ones who didn't
          fold. In fact, the folders valued their creations almost as highly as
          the origami made by experts. The researchers called this the 'IKEA
          effect', named for IKEA products that arrive as parts for the buyer to
          assemble.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But in the workplace, this can lead to problems. Software project
          managers, for example, sometimes need to scrap features of a product.
          The engineers who've developed those features, though, can feel a
          sense of ownership, and resent it when a feature is removed. They
          perceive the feature as more important than it is. Removing something
          that a person feels they own is perceived as a real loss – and the
          deep feelings of ownership aren't equally distributed. When conflict
          arises, parties on different sides of the issue might have very
          different feelings of ownership.
