          Case Study: Tourism New Zealand website
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          New Zealand is a small country of four million inhabitants, a
          long-haul flight from all the major tourist-generating markets of the
          world. Tourism currently makes up 9% of the country's gross domestic
          product, and is the country's largest export sector. Unlike other
          export sectors, which make products and then sell them overseas,
          tourism brings its customers to New Zealand. The product is the
          country itself – the people, the places and the experiences. In 1999,
          Tourism New Zealand launched a campaign to communicate a new brand
          position to the world. The campaign focused on New Zealand's scenic
          beauty, exhilarating outdoor activities and authentic Maori culture,
          and it made New Zealand one of the strongest national brands in the
          world.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          A key feature of the campaign was the website www.newzealand.com,
          which provided potential visitors to New Zealand with a single gateway
          to everything the destination had to offer. The heart of the website
          was a database of tourism services operators, both those based in New
          Zealand and those based abroad which offered tourism service to the
          country. Any tourism-related business could be listed by filling in a
          simple form. This meant that even the smallest bed and breakfast
          address or specialist activity provider could gain a web presence with
          access to an audience of long-haul visitors. In addition, because
          participating businesses were able to update the details they gave on
          a regular basis, the information provided remained accurate. And to
          maintain and improve standards, Tourism New Zealand organised a scheme
          whereby organisations appearing on the website underwent an
          independent evaluation against a set of agreed national standards of
          quality. As part of this, the effect of each business on the
          environment was considered.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          To communicate the New Zealand experience, the site also carried
          features relating to famous people and places. One of the most popular
          was an interview with former New Zealand All Blacks rugby captain Tana
          Umaga. Another feature that attracted a lot of attention was an
          interactive journey through a number of the locations chosen for
          blockbuster films which had made use of New Zealand's stunning scenery
          as a backdrop. As the site developed, additional features were added
          to help independent travelers devise their own customised itineraries.
          To make it easier to plan motoring holidays, the site catalogued the
          most popular driving routes in the country, highlighting different
          routes according to the season and indicating distances and times.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Later, a Travel Planner feature was added, which allowed visitors to
          click and 'bookmark' places or attractions they were interested in,
          and then view the results on a map. The Travel Planner offered
          suggested routes and public transport options between the chosen
          locations. There were also links to accommodation in the area. By
          registering with the website, users could save their Travel Plan and
          return to it later, or print it out to take on the visit. The website
          also had a 'Your Words' section where anyone could submit a blog of
          their New Zealand travels for possible inclusion on the website.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Tourism New Zealand website won two Webby awards for online
          achievement and innovation. More importantly perhaps, the growth of
          tourism to New Zealand was impressive. Overall tourism expenditure
          increased by an average of 6.9% per year between 1999 and 2004. From
          Britain, visits to New Zealand grew at an average annual rate of 13%
          between 2002 and 2006, compared to a rate of 4% overall for British
          visits abroad.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The website was set up to allow both individuals and travel
          organisations to create itineraries and travel packages to suit their
          own needs and interests. On the website, visitors can search for
          activities not solely by geographical location, but also by the
          particular nature of the activity. This is important as research shows
          that activities are the key driver of visitor satisfaction,
          contributing 74% to visitor satisfaction, while transport and
          accommodation account for the remaining 26%. The more activities that
          visitors undertake, the more satisfied they will be. It has also been
          found that visitors enjoy cultural activities most when they are
          interactive, such as visiting a <em>marae</em> (meeting ground) to
          learn about traditional Maori life. Many long-haul travelers enjoy
          such learning experiences, which provide them with stories to take
          home to their friends and family. In addition, it appears that
          visitors to New Zealand don't want to be 'one of the crowd' and find
          activities that involve only a few people more special and meaningful.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          It could be argued that New Zealand is not a typical destination. New
          Zealand is a small country with a visitor economy composed mainly of
          small businesses. It is generally perceived as a safe English-speaking
          country with a reliable transport infrastructure. Because of the
          long-haul flight, most visitors stay for longer (average 20 days) and
          want to see as much of the country as possible on what is often seen
          as a once-in-a-lifetime visit. However, the underlying lessons apply
          anywhere – the effectiveness of a strong brand, a strategy based on
          unique experiences and a comprehensive and user-friendly website.

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 14-26</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

          Why being bored is stimulating – and useful, too
        </h3>

        <p className="italic mb-4">
          This most common of emotions is turning out to be more interesting
          than we thought
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We all know how it feels – it's impossible to keep your mind on
          anything, time stretches out, and all the things you could do seem
          equally unlikely to make you feel better. But defining boredom so that
          it can be studied in the lab has proved difficult. For a start, it can
          include a lot of other mental states, such as frustration, apathy,
          depression and indifference. There isn't even agreement over whether
          boredom is always a low-energy, flat kind of emotion or whether
          feeling agitated and restless counts as boredom, too. In his book,{" "}
          <em>Boredom: A Lively History</em>, Peter Toohey at the University of
          Calgary, Canada, compares it to disgust – an emotion that motivates us
          to stay away from certain situations. 'If disgust protects humans from
          infection, boredom may protect them from "infectious" social
          situations,' he suggests.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          By asking people about their experiences of boredom, Thomas Goetz and
          his team at the University of Konstanz in Germany have recently
          identified five distinct types: indifferent, calibrating, searching,
          reactant and apathetic. These can be plotted on two axes – one running
          left to right, which measures low to high arousal, and the other from
          top to bottom, which measures how positive or negative the feeling is.
          Intriguingly, Goetz has found that while people experience all kinds
          of boredom, they tend to specialise in one. Of the five types, the
          most damaging is 'reactant' boredom with its explosive combination of
          high arousal and negative emotion. The most useful is what Goetz calls
          'indifferent' boredom: someone isn't engaged in anything satisfying
          but still feels relaxed and calm. However, it remains to be seen
          whether there are any character traits that predict the kind of
          boredom each of us might be prone to.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Psychologist Sandi Mann at the University of Central Lancashire, UK,
          goes further. 'All emotions are there for a reason, including
          boredom,' she says. Mann has found that being bored makes us more
          creative. 'We're all afraid of being bored but in actual fact it can
          lead to all kinds of amazing things,' she says. In experiments
          published last year, Mann found that people who had been made to feel
          bored by copying numbers out of the phone book for 15 minutes came up
          with more creative ideas about how to use a polystyrene cup than a
          control group. Mann concluded that a passive, boring activity is best
          for creativity because it allows the mind to wander. In fact, she goes
          so far as to suggest that we should seek out more boredom in our
          lives.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Psychologist John Eastwood at York University in Toronto, Canada,
          isn't convinced. 'If you are in a state of mind-wandering you are not
          bored,' he says. 'In my view, by definition boredom is an undesirable
          state.' That doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't adaptive, he adds.
          'Pain is adaptive – if we didn't have physical pain, bad things would
          happen to us. Does that mean that we should actively cause pain? No.
          But even if boredom has evolved to help us survive, it can still be
          toxic if allowed to fester.' For Eastwood, the central feature of
          boredom is a failure to put our 'attention system' into gear. This
          causes an inability to focus on anything, which makes time seem to go
          painfully slowly. What's more, your efforts to improve the situation
          can end up making you feel worse. 'People try to connect with the
          world and if they are not successful there's that frustration and
          irritability,' he says. Perhaps most worryingly, says Eastwood,
          repeatedly failing to engage attention can lead to state where we
          don't know what to do any more, and no longer care.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Eastwood's team is now trying to explore why the attention system
          fails. It's early days but they think that at least some of it comes
          down to personality. Boredom proneness has been linked with a variety
          of traits. People who are motivated by pleasure seem to suffer
          particularly badly. Other personality traits, such as curiosity, are
          associated with a high boredom threshold. More evidence that boredom
          has detrimental effects comes from studies of people who are more or
          less prone to boredom. It seems those who bore easily face poorer
          prospects in education, their career and even life in general. But of
          course, boredom itself cannot kill – it's the things we do to deal
          with it that may put us in danger. What can we do to alleviate it
          before it comes to that? Goetz's group has one suggestion. Working
          with teenagers, they found that those who 'approach' a boring
          situation – in other words, see that it's boring and get stuck in
          anyway – report less boredom than those who try to avoid it by using
          snacks, TV or social media for distraction.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Psychologist Francoise Wemelsfelder speculates that our over-connected
          lifestyles might even be a new source of boredom. 'In modern human
          society there is a lot of overstimulation but still a lot of problems
          finding meaning,' she says. So instead of seeking yet more mental
          stimulation, perhaps we should leave our phones alone, and use boredom
          to motivate us to engage with the world in a more meaningful way.

        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4 mt-8">READING PASSAGE 3</h2>

        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Artificial artist?</h3>

        <p className="italic mb-4">Can computers really create works of art?</p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Painting Fool is one of a growing number of computer programs
          which, so their makers claim, possess creative talents. Classical
          music by an artificial composer has had audiences enraptured, and even
          tricked them into believing a human was behind the score. Artworks
          painted by a robot have sold for thousands of dollars and been hung in
          prestigious galleries. And software has been built which creates are
          that could not have been imagined by the programmer.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Human beings are the only species to perform sophisticated creative
          acts regularly. If we can break this process down into computer code,
          where does that leave human creativity? 'This is a question at the
          very core of humanity,' says Geraint Wiggins, a computational
          creativity researcher at Goldsmiths, University of London. 'It scares
          a lot of people. They are worried that it is taking something special
          away from what it means to be human.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          To some extent, we are all familiar with computerised art. The
          question is: where does the work of the artist stop and the creativity
          of the computer begin? Consider one of the oldest machine artists,
          Aaron, a robot that has had paintings exhibited in London's Tate
          Modern and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Aaron can pick up a
          paintbrush and paint on canvas on its own. Impressive perhaps, but it
          is still little more than a tool to realise the programmer's own
          creative ideas.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Simon Colton, the designer of the Painting Fool, is keen to make sure
          his creation doesn't attract the same criticism. Unlike earlier
          'artists' such as Aaron, the Painting Fool only needs minimal
          direction and can come up with its own concepts by going online for
          material. The software runs its own web searches and trawls through
          social media sites. It is now beginning to display a kind of
          imagination too, creating pictures from scratch. One of its original
          works is a series of fuzzy landscapes, depicting trees and sky. While
          some might say they have a mechanical look, Colton argues that such
          reactions arise from people's double standards towards
          software-produced and human-produced art. After all, he says, consider
          that the Painting Fool painted the landscapes without referring to a
          photo. 'If a child painted a new scene from its head, you'd say it has
          a certain level of imagination,' he points out. 'The same should be
          true of a machine.' Software bugs can also lead to unexpected results.
          Some of the Painting Fool's paintings of a chair came out in black and
          white, thanks to a technical glitch. This gives the work an eerie,
          ghostlike quality. Human artists like the renowned Ellsworth Kelly are
          lauded for limiting their colour palette – so why should computers be
          any different?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Researchers like Colton don't believe it is right to measure machine
          creativity directly to that of humans who 'have had millennia to
          develop our skills'. Others, though, are fascinated by the prospect
          that a computer might create something as original and subtle as our
          best artists. So far, only one has come close. Composer David Cope
          invented a program called Experiments in Musical Intelligence, or EMI.
          Not only did EMI create compositions in Cope's style, but also that of
          the most revered classical composers, including Bach, Chopin and
          Mozart. Audiences were moved to tears, and EMI even fooled classical
          music experts into thinking they were hearing genuine Bach. Not
          everyone was impressed however. Some, such as Wiggins, have blasted
          Cope's work as pseudoscience, and condemned him for his deliberately
          vague explanation of how the software worked. Meanwhile, Douglas
          Hofstadter of Indiana University said EMI created replicas which still
          rely completely on the original artist's creative impulses. When
          audiences found out the truth they were often outraged with Cope, and
          one music lover even tried to punch him. Amid such controversy, Cope
          destroyed EMI's vital databases.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          But why did so many people love the music, yet recoil when the
          discovered how it was composed? A study by computer scientist David
          Moffat of Glasgow Caledonian University provides a clue. He asked both
          expert musicians and non-experts to assess six compositions. The
          participants weren't told beforehand whether the tunes were composed
          by humans or computers, but were asked to guess, and then rate how
          much they liked each one. People who thought the composer was a
          computer tended to dislike the piece more than those who believed it
          was human. This was true even among the experts, who might have been
          expected to be more objective in their analyses.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Where does this prejudice come from? Paul Bloom of Yale University has
          a suggestion: he reckons part of the pleasure we get from art stems
          from the creative process behind the work. This can give it an
          'irresistible essence', says Bloom. Meanwhile, experiments by Justin
          Kruger of New York University have shown that people's enjoyment of an
          artwork increases if they think more time and effort was needed to
          create it. Similarly, Colton thinks that when people experience art,
          they wonder what the artist might have been thinking or what the
          artist is trying to tell them. It seems obvious, therefore, that with
          computers producing art, this speculation is cut short – there's
          nothing to explore. But as technology becomes increasingly complex,
          finding those greater depths in computer art could become possible.
          This is precisely why Colton asks the Painting Fool to tap into online
          social networks for its inspiration: hopefully this way it will choose
          themes that will already be meaningful to us.
