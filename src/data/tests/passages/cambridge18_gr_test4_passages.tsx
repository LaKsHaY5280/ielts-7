          <h4 className="font-bold mb-2 mt-4">The best ice cream makers</h4>

          <p className="mb-2 italic">
            Have you ever considered making ice cream at home but thought it
            would be too complicated? Here is a selection of machines that could
            change your mind
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A Magimix Gelato Expert</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If you're an ice cream fanatic, it doesn't get better than this.
            It's quick, taking as little as 20 minutes, and consistent in its
            results, while the three automated programmes are very easy to use
            and it has an unusually generous two-litre capacity. On the other
            hand, we found it noisier than many, and the ice cream is softer
            than we might have liked.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B Shake n Make Ice Cream Maker</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If you want to make some basic soft ice cream, this is a fun little
            gadget that gets decent results. You add a little ice and salt to
            the base, then your ingredients to the stainless-steel tub, pop the
            lid on and give it a good shake for at least three minutes. Provided
            you measure everything exactly and shake back and forth
            consistently, it's surprisingly efficient.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C Sage Smart Scoop</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This is a seriously smart machine. Our favourite feature is the
            built-in sensor that works out whether the consistency of your ice
            cream or frozen yoghurt is right for you (from the 12 hardness
            settings) so that it can stop mixing when it's ready, alerting you
            with a fun tune. As you'd expect from the considerable price tag,
            there's a built-in freezer and it feels beautifully engineered.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">
            D Lakeland Digital Ice Cream Maker
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You simply pop on the lid and pour in the ingredients, then set the
            timer using the nice, clear digital display. Some customers
            reportedly struggled to disassemble it in order to wash the bowl and
            paddle, but we didn't have that problem. We're also giving it extra
            points for the recipe book, which has some really tasty ideas.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E Judge Ice Cream Maker</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We had a few criticisms, perhaps not surprisingly when you consider
            this is one of the cheapest models in our selection – notably the
            fact that the paddle isn't as robust as the ones in other models.
            We'd have liked more recipes, too. But, for a budget machine, this
            is a bargain.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">
            F KitchenAid Artisan Ice Cream Maker
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If you own a KitchenAid food mixer, this attachment (one of 15 that
            fits this machine) is a good way to start ice cream making. You
            simply freeze the bowl before use and attach it to the mixer (a
            quick and easy job) and pour in your favourite fresh ingredients,
            with some recipes taking just 20 minutes.

            Respiratory Protective Equipment – advice for factory employees
          </h4>

          <p className="mb-4">
            You need to wear Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE) when you're
            doing work where you could breathe in hazardous substances in the
            air such as dust, vapour or gas. Common health effects from
            breathing hazardous substances include sore eyes and headaches. Make
            sure you are using the right RPE for the task. For example, negative
            pressure respirators should not be used in low oxygen environments.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Some types of RPE must have a tight seal around the facial area to
            be effective. Your employer will arrange a yearly facial fit test to
            ensure that you are given RPE that fits properly. This checks that
            the seal between the respirator and the facial area is secure, by
            releasing a substance that you can smell or taste if the RPE is not
            working properly. RPE will only provide effective protection if you
            are clean shaven. Facial hair growth makes it almost impossible to
            get a good seal so, if you have a beard, you should talk to your
            employer about other forms of RPE that do not rely on a tight facial
            fit. Jewellery and long hair can also compromise an effective fit.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Using your RPE</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You should complete a visual check of your RPE for signs of damage
            before you use it. If you are using RPE that requires a tight fit,
            you must check it fits properly before entering a hazardous area.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Cleaning your RPE</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Wash and dry your RPE after using it. Use a mild detergent, as harsh
            products such as solvents can cause damage. Use a brush and warm
            water and rinse with clean water. This will remove excess detergent
            that can cause skin irritation. Dry your RPE on a solid wooden rack
            or suspend from a clothes line.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Maintaining your RPE</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Inspect your RPE after each use and during cleaning. Make sure you
            check the straps for breaks, tears, fraying edges and deterioration
            of elasticity. Check the inhalation and exhalation valves are
            working and not damaged.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Storing your RPE</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Improper storage can cause distortion to your RPE. Store your RPE in
            a clean, dry place, away from dust, oil and sunlight. RPE should be
            stored so that it doesn't get crushed.

            Working with cows in a dairy : Guidelines for employers
          </h4>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Slips and trips</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Slips and trips are one of the most common accidents when working in
            farm dairies. They often happen when working with cows in a dairy
            during milking, and during maintenance and cleaning.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            The following three hazards make it more likely that employees will
            slip or trip:
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-2 mb-1">
            1. Surfaces which are wet or dirty
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li className="mb-1">
              Have a system for cleaning up milk, oil, cleaning fluid and grain
              spills as soon as they happen, and make sure it is followed.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-1">
              Install non-slip mats in wet work areas and make sure that
              footwear is slip-resistant.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="font-bold mt-2 mb-1">
            2. Obstacles such as pipes or cables in the farm dairy
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li className="mb-1">
              Reduce tripping accidents by hanging hoses and pipes along walls
              out of people's way and remove unused fittings, like bolt
              fasteners in floors.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-1">
              Move obstacles from walkways and entrances where possible.
              Tripping hazards which cannot be removed should be clearly
              indicated with yellow tape. If there are obstacles overhead, these
              should be wrapped in padding to avoid risk of injury.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="font-bold mt-2 mb-1">
            3. Steps which are too high or not deep enough, or steps in poorly
            lit areas
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li className="mb-1">
              Build steps properly and use non-slip surfaces.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-1">Handrails should also be fitted.</li>
            <li className="mb-1">
              The provision of good lighting can also help to reduce the risk of
              injury.
            </li>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Lifting and carrying</p>

            <li className="mb-1">lifting buckets of grain, water and milk</li>

              Where possible, use trolleys and other mechanical aids to replace

          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li className="mb-1">
              Think about designing or changing the milking area so workers can
              change the height they are working at to suit them. Ensure that
              all equipment needed is close by to avoid workers having to
              overreach or adopt a bending position.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-1">
              Alternate between jobs to reduce repetitious manual handling

          <h4 className="font-bold mb-2 mt-4">Night photography in autumn</h4>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            November in the northern hemisphere is not the most inspiring of
            months for the photographer. The days shorten appreciably as winter
            approaches and the last autumn leaves are blown free by high winds
            and frequent rain. Nature seems dormant, as many birds have long
            since flown to warmer climates, fungi break through the earth, and
            many animal species sleep until spring's warm awakening. It would
            seem a good time also to put the camera to bed and forget about
            photography until the first snowfall. Well, not quite. With the days
            being shorter and daylight less bright, November is an excellent
            month to turn your attention to what can be found in the long
            darkness from dusk to dawn. In the nocturnal hours a vast number of
            life forms still thrive, and provide a completely different set of
            subjects to those the daylight hours present.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            As the most noticeable object in the night sky, the moon is an
            obvious subject when making your initial attempts at night
            photography. The timing of an evening moonrise is important to know
            because, not only does it vary according to the time of year, but
            the moon always appears largest at this point, when it is closest to
            the horizon. To capture the moon at its brilliant best, you need a
            bit of luck too: a time when its brightest phase – a full moon –
            coincides with the ideal weather forecast of a cloudless night sky.
            The moon is not a direct light source such as the sun or the stars;
            instead it is reflecting the light of the sun hitting its surface.
            On such a night, a full moon will reflect only about ten percent of
            the sunlight, but that is still enough to illuminate buildings,
            trees, bridges and other landscape features.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            With today's cameras, far greater detail can be rendered. Whole
            constellations consisting of thousands of points of starlight
            filling the frame and even galaxies such as our own Milky Way can be
            captured. This is a type of night photography for which few of us
            had suitable equipment a decade ago, but now it has become
            accessible to all photographers, thanks to the much improved,
            affordable technology.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            However, photographers choosing to shoot the moon may be less
            concerned by this, as they tend to prefer to use telephoto lenses to
            magnify the size of the moon, particularly when it is low in the sky
            and can be shown in relation to a landmark or recognisable structure
            within the frame.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Of course, the nocturnal world offers other subjects closer to the
            ground, some that are even familiar to us by day. As cities and
            towns spread further into our green spaces, some wild animals move
            further afield to escape our intrusions, while others adapt to their
            new urbanised surroundings.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            In European cities, sightings of foxes at night are increasingly
            common, as they thrive thanks to the cover of darkness and a ready
            supply of residents' waste bins, which they use as feeding stations.
            Deer and wild boar are larger mammals that have also adapted to the
            urban fringes in recent years, emerging from the cover of parks and
            nearby forests to forage in residential gardens by night.

            Such is the proliferation of urban wildlife that some photographers
            now specialise in documenting the nocturnal animals that have
            developed a taste for city nightlife. The improvement in camera
            technology that has made night sky images more accessible has also
            extended the creative repertoire of the wildlife photographer. It is
            now possible to photograph some wild species at night, or soon after
            dusk, without having to always resort to the use of specialist
            equipment.

            More exciting still is how the techniques of astro-photography and
            the wildlife camera-trap have combined in recent years, to produce
            images of nocturnal animals against a background of a star-studded
            night sky. This marriage of two photographic genres has created an
            innovative style of night photography.

            If that all sounds a bit too complex and time-consuming, with too
            many variables to spoil the hoped-for result, then consider using
            the fading light of the night sky in the brief time after dusk in a
            more opportunistic manner. Dusk is the part of the nocturnal phase
            when the light of the sun is still visible, though the sun itself
            has disappeared completely. During the earliest phase of dusk there
            is enough ambient light remaining to enable features in our
            surroundings to be seen without the aid of artificial light sources
            such as floodlights or street lamps.

          <p className="mb-4">
            While many of us shoot sunsets, the period of dusk also provides an
            opportunity to use the ambient light low in the sky as a backdrop to
            photographing foreground subjects in varying stages of illumination,
            or even as shadowy outlines against the fading sky. The variety of
            possible subjects includes ships at sea, flocks of low-flying birds,
            trees, windmills, skyscrapers and high bridges. These are all well
            known by day, but against a night sky at dusk they lack colour, so
            any compositional strength is determined by the graphic appeal of
            their distinct and recognisable shapes.
