          Singapore Guide: A walk around the Orchard Road district
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The route begins just opposite the Orchard MRT station at the
          Singapore Marriott Hotel. This eye-catching landmark has a distinctive
          Chinese-styled green roof and red pillars.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          In 1958 a former lace—pedlar, C. K. Tang, foresaw that the area could
          become a bustling shopping centre, since residents in the neighbouring
          Tanglin district had to pass enroute to work at the commercial centre,
          Raffles Place. So with roof tiles brought in from his hometown in the
          Swatow province of China, Tang built a department store on what was
          then a cheap, isolated plot of land. The plot faced a cemetery, which
          is considered a bad omen in Chinese culture. His foresight paid off.
          Today, Tangs is one of Singapore's most prominent and recognised home
          grown department stores, proudly showcasing local fashion and
          household products. Even when the original building was torn down in
          1982 to give way to the present superstore and skyscraper hotel, it
          retained its unique Chinese architecture.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          From the foyer at Tangs, turn left to Lucky Plaza. One of the oldest
          along Orchard Road, this mall is a perennial favourite with shoppers.
          Be amazed by the staggering array of cosmetics, jewellery, leather
          goods and hi-fi equipment. Prices, though, are not always fixed, so
          bring along a good set of bargaining skills.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Coming out of Lucky Plaza, continue along Orchard Road and enter the
          Paragon Shopping Centre. Apart from a wide range of shops and
          restaurants, there is also a Singapore Airlines Service Centre to
          facilitate bookings and offer information to tourists. Also available
          are a number of computer terminals for self-booking. Check out the
          life-sized sculptures by a well known Taiwanese sculptor, Sun Yu-li,
          outside the shopping centre. These were inspired by depictions of life
          in rock paintings dating back 20,000 years ago in Inner Mongolia.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">
          Writing a personal CV that will attract employers
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          You are unique. No-one has the same behavioural make-up that you have.
          Likewise, everyone's career history is also unique. Why is it then
          that a great many CVs are mostly descriptions of past jobs or standard
          CV templates and give away very little about the individual behind the
          CV? It's almost as if the majority of job seekers are afraid to let
          their own personality shine through.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Perhaps in a corporate world where everyone feels they have to have
          the same professional image — dress in dark, formal suits, for example
          — the same is subconsciously felt to be true for CV writing. But
          there's a difficulty here: you want your CV to stand out and yet at
          the same time are afraid of saying anything that might make you stand
          out? The problem with the above thinking is painfully clear. Your CV
          will be dull, and likely to be swiftly passed over by an employer.
          Surely it is much better to be brave? To define your personal brand,
          as marketers might say. This isn't about making unsupportable
          statements: it's about choosing words that describe the qualities that
          drive your success. In short, what makes you good at your job.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Writing about oneself can sometimes be difficult. It involves the
          ability to see yourself from different people's viewpoints. Working
          with a professional CV writer is one way to achieve that and to
          present your character positively within a CV. Asking a colleague that
          you trust is also a good way to find out how others see your
          strengths.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Try not to use classic recruitment clichés. Everyone says they have
          great 'communication' or 'organisational' skills. This gets ignored by
          recruiters. So, instead think carefully about who you are and what you
          bring and then try to describe yourself. In that way you give
          recruiters something original to engage with, something that grabs
          their attention.

          The value of being organised at work
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Being organised is one of the most effective skills a businessperson
          can acquire because when we're organised, we think more clearly. We're
          in tune with our targets and know how to reach them. Here are my top
          tips to bring order to your business life:
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Organise your workspace</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Don't underestimate time lost or stress caused from an inefficient
          working environment. To restore order:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-justify">
          <li>
            Cut down documents and stationery to the bare essentials. Be
            ruthless and remove anything that doesn't directly serve a function
            in your day-to-day activity. One or two carefully selected photos to
            make your desk feel like home are fine, but avoid too many.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create locations where you will keep all your work materials to make
            retrieval easy. Do this logically based on where you tend to use the
            items; for example, store spare copy paper near the printer. Move
            outside your immediate reach anything you use infrequently. Always
            return items once you have used them so they'll be where you expect
            them next time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Frustration ensues when you're searching for a client proposal, but
            it's buried among random papers. Eliminate desktop chaos by using
            trays, magazine files, or whatever you fancy and add clear labels
            such as 'In', 'Out', 'For Action', 'Current Projects' or other
            relevant categories.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be brutally honest about what you must keep. Studies suggest that
            80% of what we file is never accessed again. Ask: do I know of a tax
            or legal requirement for retaining it? Why would this be important
            to me in future? Avoid 'miscellaneous' as a category — you won't
            remember what's in there.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Effective planning</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Plan your work; work your plan. Time spent planning saves untold hours
          in execution. Implementing regular planning strategies will sharpen
          your focus, thereby keeping you on track with your work. Start
          planning today for tomorrow. Near the close of each work day,
          implement a 10- to 15-minute routine to wrap up loose ends and
          prioritise key tasks. A good plan for tomorrow allows you to clear
          your head and enjoy your evening. Once a week, ring-fence a 60-to
          90-minute appointment with yourself for larger scale planning. Use the
          time to do research or any of the thinking that normally takes a back
          seat.

          A significant development in mining safety
        </h3>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Coal has been used as a source of fuel for over 5,000 years, but for
          most of that time it was probably gathered from places where it was
          exposed on the surface of the ground. It is possible that the Romans
          undertook some mining, but coal mines across Europe largely date from
          the 13th century. Thereafter coal production increased steadily and it
          gradually replaced charcoal and wood as a source of heat and energy.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Initially, coal mines were fairly shallow, but they quickly reached
          the point where artificial lighting was necessary. At first the lights
          used would have been no different from those used domestically –
          candles and simple oil lamps. But as coal mines became deeper, miners
          encountered a new and terrible problem – firedamp. This was a natural
          gas, principally consisting of methane, that exploded on contact with
          a naked flame. The first known major firedamp explosion, which killed
          99 people, took place in Belgium in 1514 and as new technology was
          used to mine at increasingly deep levels, the problem got worse.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The simplest solution was to improve the ventilation of the mine. Many
          mines had only one shaft leading from the surface down to the working
          area below. Ventilation could be improved to some extent by dividing
          this into a downcast (bringing in fresh air) and an upcast (returning
          foul air and firedamp to the surface).
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          But what was really needed was a safe lamp that could not ignite
          firedamp. The earliest forms of safety lighting sought to produce
          light without using a naked flame. One early method tried to utilise
          the fact that skins removed from decaying fish contain the element
          phosphorus, which emits light in the form of phosphorescence.
          Unfortunately, this phosphorus is highly toxic, flammable and can
          self-ignite-hardly desirable properties in a safety light.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          An alternative was a device invented in about 1750, consisting of a
          flint which struck against a piece of iron when a handle was turned,
          creating a shower of sparks which lit up the surrounding area. These
          were believed to be too cool to ignite firedamp. This device had major
          drawbacks – extra manpower had to be used to operate it continuously,
          and it also required regular maintenance and replacement. But worst of
          all, it was not in fact safe, and numerous accidents were caused when
          the sparks ignited firedamp. Nonetheless, it was considered to be the
          least dangerous form of lighting at the time.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          By about 1810 the problem was becoming acute, and in some cases there
          was no alternative to working in the dark. Some mines were being
          forced to stop production, with serious economic consequences for the
          mine owners and local communities. The general response, however, was
          to keep going and reluctantly accept the inevitable deaths from
          ignition of firedamp as a regrettable, but not especially remarkable,
          consequence of coal mining.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The miners themselves could do little - they were largely illiterate,
          and depended on the mine owners for a livelihood. However, the
          clerical, medical and legal professions were beginning to take notice.
          After 92 men and boys were killed in 1812 by an explosion at Felling
          Colliery in northern England, several professional people took action
          and a society was set up to raise funds for the discovery of new
          methods of lighting and ventilating mines. The first report of the
          society stated, 'It is to scientific men only that we must look up for
          assistance in providing a cheap and effectual remedy.'
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          As the leading chemist of the day, and an expert on gases, Sir
          Humphrey Davy was a natural choice from whom to seek help, and he was
          approached by the society in 1815. The general belief nowadays is that
          he was the inventor of the first miners' safety lamp, in which the
          flame was enclosed by a mesh screen containing very small holes. Air
          could enter the lamp through the holes, but they were too small to
          allow the flame of the lamp to pass through them and ignite any
          firedamp present in the mine tunnels. Davy presented a paper
          describing the lamp in November 1815, and it was trialled in January
          1816.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          However, a few weeks prior to Davy's presentation, an engineer called
          George Stephenson had independently designed and demonstrated a lamp
          based on the same scientific principles. After much discussion and
          argument, he was eventually recognised as deserving equal credit for
          the discovery, but the time needed for this recognition to be given
          meant that the miners' safety lamp had already been called the 'Davy
          lamp', and it is still called that today.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          But in fact, the real inventor of the safety lamp was a man called Dr
          William Reid Clanny, who in 1813 had been awarded a silver medal by
          the Royal Society of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce for his own
          version of a safety lamp. Clancy's first lamp did not fulfil the needs
          of the ordinary working miner as it was rather heavy and cumbersome.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          But rather than seeking to glory in his achievement, he recognised its
          deficiencies and continued to work to improve it, as well as sharing
          his knowledge with others. George Stephenson acknowledged a debt to
          Clanny's research, and Humphrey Davy visited him in 1815 shortly
          before completing the design for his own safety lamp but to this day
          Dr Clanny remains a forgotten hero.
