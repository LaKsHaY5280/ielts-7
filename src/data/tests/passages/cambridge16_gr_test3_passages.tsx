          Maps showing walks starting from Bingham Town Hall
        </h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>A</strong> The walk described in this leaflet takes you to one
          of the many places in the district where bricks were made for hundreds
          of years, until it was closed in the late 19th century. This
          brickworks is now the largest and best-known nature reserve in the
          area. Please note that the ground is very uneven, and under-sixes
          should not be taken on this walk.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>B</strong> This walk will take you to the top of Burley Hill,
          along a nice easy path that people of all ages will be able to manage.
          From the summit you can see for a great distance to the north and
          west, across a landscape that includes half a dozen lakes and the
          entrance to Butter Caves. Bear in mind, though, that mist often comes
          in from the sea and covers the hilltop.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>C</strong> This route leads you through the village of
          Cottesloe, which was created in the 1930s and is famous for its
          strange-looking houses and ceramics factory, which is still the
          largest employer in the area. An artificial lake was originally
          created beside the village, and has since been filled in and turned
          into an adventure playground. After you leave Cottesloe, you have a
          choice of routes to return to the starting point, so either continue
          via Thurley Park, or if it's raining, take the shorter direct route.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>D</strong> This walk is ideal in fine weather, as it takes you
          to the shore of a lake, at a spot convenient for swimming. Children
          will want to enjoy themselves in the adventure playground nearby. From
          there you continue to Starling Cottage, which draws people from around
          the world to visit the home, from 1920 to 1927, of the poet Barbara
          Cottam.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>E</strong> If you want an easy, undemanding walk over flat
          ground, this walk will suit you perfectly. It passes the entrance to
          the famous Butter Caves visitor attraction, so you can combine a visit
          there with the walk, or just take shelter if it starts raining! On the
          final stage of the walk you pass through Wimpole, the village where
          Richard Merton, the architect of a number of local buildings, lived
          for much of his life.

          The Maplehampton scarecrow competition – a great success!
        </h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There was once a time when farmers all over the country put scarecrows
          in fields of growing crops. A traditional scarecrow was a model –
          usually life-size – of a man or woman dressed in old clothes, and
          their purpose was to frighten the birds away; though how successful
          they were is a matter of opinion!
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Maplehampton's scarecrow competition took place on September 12th.
          Local farmers supplied everything needed to make a scarecrow – like
          pieces of wood to form a frame, and straw to stuff the scarecrow. The
          scarecrows were dressed in old clothes which the competitors brought
          with them.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The festival was held in the village hall, instead of outdoors as
          planned, due to the unusually high temperature. There were two
          classes, one for adults and one for children, all of them working in
          small teams. Over 20 teams took part, each creating one scarecrow.
          They were encouraged by an audience of around 50, and had ideas and
          guidance from local artist Tracey Sanzo.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The scarecrows were judged by a team of people from the village. The
          winning children's team made a scarecrow that looked like a giant bird
          – which would surely keep every real bird away! The winning adult
          team's scarecrow was dressed as an alien from another planet, and its
          face was painted to make it look very frightening – at least to human
          beings!
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          After the judging, many of the participants and the spectators had a
          picnic which they had brought. Some of the scarecrows then went home
          to their creators' gardens. Alice Cameron, a local farmer, liked one
          of the scarecrows so much, she bought it to stand on her balcony: she
          said she didn't need it to scare birds away from her crops, as only
          bird-scarers that made a noise were effective. She just wanted to be
          able to see it! The event raised over £300 for village funds.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4">SECTION 2: Questions 15-27</h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 15-27</strong>,
          which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">Qualities that make a great barista</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Truly great baristas take the time to develop the key skills that will
          enable them to deliver the highest possible quality of coffee-based
          beverage and service. As a barista, you must make a concerted effort
          to listen to your clientele and make sure the drinks you produce are
          correct in all respects. This is particularly important when you
          consider the sheer range and complexity of modern coffee drinks, which
          may start from a single (or double) shot of espresso but can include
          many additional elements. If you become distracted by the conversation
          that is going on nearby, you may ultimately miss the mark from a
          service perspective.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          One thing that separates a great from a good barista is that the
          former is constantly busy and has a strong work ethic. You will often
          catch a great barista rinsing out the filter in their machines, for
          example, as this erodes the build-up of burnt coffee oil that can
          begin to impact on the quality and taste of each espresso shot.
          Similarly, do not be surprised to hear the sound of the coffee grinder
          at work. This highlights the keen attention to detail that
          distinguishes skilled baristas, as they have the desire and the
          awareness to make every drink with completely fresh ground coffee.
          This type of attentiveness helps baristas to get the most from the
          coffee that they use, as many of the delicate aromas found in espresso
          are lost when exposed to the open air.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Timing is everything when it comes to producing the perfect cup of
          coffee. A great barista knows precisely when to finish the extraction
          of espresso, at the point when the balance of flavour has reached its
          optimum levels. They also understand how important this is; those who
          act too soon are left with a drink without flavour while those who
          delay the finish risk burning the beverage and tainting it with a
          bitter after-taste.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          When it comes to customer service, there is so much more to a coffee
          shop experience than drinking perfectly roasted blends. The atmosphere
          and the ambience also play a central role, and the interaction that
          the customer has with their barista sets the tone for an enjoyable
          experience. Great baristas ask their customers how their day is going
          or what they're going to do later; they read local newspapers and keep
          up with issues that really matter, all of which make a real difference
          in a competitive marketplace.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold my-4">Running a meeting</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Prior to the meeting, think about the seating and arrange it in an
          appropriate way. A circle can work well for informal meetings, but
          sometimes the furniture cannot be re-arranged or rows are more
          suitable. Consider the participants and decide what is best. Before
          people arrive, it's a good idea to designate someone to stand at the
          entrance and greet everyone.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          If the meeting is small, start by requesting everyone to introduce
          themselves and to give a bit of relevant information in addition to
          their name. This may be what they do or why they are there. For all
          meetings, you need to introduce the chairperson, i.e., yourself, and
          any other outside speakers you have invited.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Next, make sure everyone can see the agenda or has a copy of it.
          Briefly run through the items then take one point at a time, and make
          sure the group doesn't stray from that point until it has been dealt
          with. Encourage participation at all times so that attendees can
          contribute but don't let everyone talk at the same time. Try to keep
          discussions positive, but don't ignore conflicts – find a solution for
          them and make sure they are resolved before they grow.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Summarise points regularly and make clear action points. Write these
          down and don't forget to note who's doing what, and by when. Encourage
          everyone to feel able to volunteer for tasks and roles. It can help if
          the more experienced members of the group offer to share skills and
          knowledge, but don't let the same people take on all the work as this
          can lead to tension within the group.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          At the end, remember to thank everyone for turning up and
          contributing. It can be nice to follow the meeting with a social
          activity like sharing a meal or going to a cafe.

          Feathers as decoration in European history
        </h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>A</strong> Today, we do not generally associate feathers with
          the military in Europe, yet history shows that in fact feathers have
          played an intriguing role in European military clothing. The
          Bersaglieri of the Italian Army, for example, still wear a bunch of
          long black feathers in their hats hanging down to one side, while
          British fusiliers have a clipped feather plume whose colour varies
          according to their regiment. The Royalists in the English Civil War
          adorned their headgear with ostrich feathers. 'Historically, feathers
          were an incredibly expressive accessory for men,' observes Cambridge
          historian, Professor Ulinka Rublack. 'Nobody has really looked at why
          this was the case. That's a story that I want to tell.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Rublack is beginning to study the use of featherwork in early modern
          fashion as part of a joint project between the Universities of
          Cambridge, Basel and Bern. To the outsider, its preoccupations (her
          co-researchers are studying gold, glass and veils) might seem
          surprising. Yet such materials sustained significant economies and
          expertise.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>B</strong> Rublack has spotted that something unusual started
          to happen with feathers during the 16th century. In 1500, they were
          barely worn at all in Europe; 100 years later they had become an
          indispensable accessory for the fashionable European man. In
          prosperous trading centres, the citizens started wearing hats bedecked
          with feathers from cranes and swallows. Headgear was specially
          manufactured so that feathers could be inserted more easily. By 1573,
          Plantin's Flemish-French dictionary was even obliged to offer words to
          describe people who chose not to wear them, recommending such terms
          as: 'the featherless' and 'unfeathered'.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Featherworking became big business. From Prague and Nuremberg to Paris
          and Madrid, people started to make a living from decorating feathers
          for clothing. Impressive efforts went into dyeing them. A 1548 recipe
          recommends using ashes, lead monoxide and river water to create a
          'very beautiful' black, for example.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>C</strong> Why this happened will become clearer as Rublack's
          project develops. One crucial driver, however, was exploration – the
          discovery of new lands, especially in South America. Compared with
          many of the other species that early European colonists encountered,
          exotic birds could be captured, transported and kept with relative
          ease. Europe experienced a sudden 'bird-craze', as exotic birds became
          a relatively common sight in the continent's largest markets.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Given the link with new territories and conquest, ruling elites wore
          feathers partly to express their power and reach. But there were also
          more complex reasons. In 1599, for example, Duke Frederick of
          Wurttemberg held a display at his court at which he personally
          appeared wearing a costume covered in exotic feathers and representing
          the Americas. This was not just a symbol of power, but of cultural
          connectedness, Rublack suggests: The message seems to be that he was
          embracing the global in a duchy that was quite insular and
          territorial.'
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>D</strong> Nor were feathers worn by the powerful alone. In
          1530, a legislative assembly at Augsburg imposed restrictions on
          peasants and traders adopting what it clearly felt should be an elite
          fashion. The measure did not last, perhaps because health manuals of
          the era recommended feathers could keep the wearer safe from 'bad' air
          – cold, miasma, damp or excessive heat – all of which were regarded as
          hazardous. During the 1550s, Eleanor of Toledo had hats made from
          peacock feathers to keep her dry in the rain. Gradually, feathers came
          to indicate that the wearer was healthy and civilised. Artists and
          musicians took to wearing them as a mark of subtlety and style.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>E</strong> As with most fads, this enthusiasm eventually wore
          off. By the mid-17th century, feathers were out of style, with one
          striking exception. Within the armies of Europe feathers remained an
          essential part of military costume. Rublack thinks that there may have
          been several reasons for this strange contradiction. 'It's associated
          with the notion of graceful warfaring,' she says. This was a period
          when there were no standing armies and it was hard to draft soldiers.
          One solution was to aestheticise the military, to make it seem
          graceful and powerful.' Feathers became associated with the idea of an
          art of warfare. They were also already a part of military garb among
          many native American peoples and in the Ottoman empire. Rublack
          believes that just as some of these cultures considered the feathers
          of certain birds to be highly significant, and sometimes sacred,
          European soldiers saw the feathers as imparting noble passions,
          bravery and courage.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>F</strong> In time, her research may therefore reveal a
          tension about the ongoing use of feathers in this unlikely context.
          But, as she also notes, she is perhaps the first historian to have
          spotted the curious emotional resonance of feathers in military
          fashion at all. All this shows a sea-change in methodologies:
          historians now chart the ways in which our identities are shaped
          through deep connections with 'stuff' – the material objects that are
          parts of our lives.
