        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">The concept of intelligence</h3>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Looked at in one way, everyone knows what intelligence is; looked at
          in another way, no one does. In other words, people all have
          unconscious notions – known as 'implicit theories' – of intelligence,
          but no one knows for certain what it actually is. This chapter
          addresses how people conceptualize intelligence, whatever it may
          actually be.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          But why should we even care what people think intelligence is, as
          opposed only to valuing whatever it actually is? There are at least
          four seasons people's conceptions of intelligence matter.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          First, implicit theories of intelligence drive the way in which people
          perceive and evaluate their own intelligence and that of others. To
          better understand the judgments people make about their own and
          others' abilities, it is useful to learn about people's implicit
          theories. For example, parents' implicit theories of their children's
          language development will determine at what ages they will be willing
          to make various corrections in their children's speech. More
          generally, parents' implicit theories of intelligence will determine
          at what ages they believe their children are ready to perform various
          cognitive tasks. Job interviewers will make hiring decisions on the
          basis of their implicit theories of intelligence. People will decide
          who to be friends with on the basis of such theories. In sum,
          knowledge about implicit theories of intelligence is important because
          this knowledge is so often used by people to make judgments in the
          course of their everyday lives.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Second, the implicit theories of scientific investigators ultimately
          give rise to their explicit theories. Thus it is useful to find out
          what these implicit theories are. Implicit theories provide a
          framework that is useful in defining the general scope of a phenomenon
          – especially a not-well-understood phenomenon. These implicit theories
          can suggest what aspects of the phenomenon have been more or less
          attended to in previous investigations.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Third, implicit theories can be useful when an investigator suspects
          that existing explicit theories are wrong or misleading. If an
          investigation of implicit theories reveals little correspondence
          between the extant implicit and explicit theories, the implicit
          theories may be wrong. But the possibility also needs to be taken into
          account that the explicit theories are wrong and in need of correction
          or supplementation. For example, some implicit theories of
          intelligence suggest the need for expansion of some of our explicit
          theories of the construct.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Finally, understanding implicit theories of intelligence can help
          elucidate developmental and cross-cultural differences. As mentioned
          earlier, people have expectations for intellectual performances that
          differ for children of different ages. How these expectations differ
          is in part a function of culture. For example, expectations for
          children who participate in Western-style schooling are almost certain
          to be different from those for children who do not participate in such
          schooling.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I have suggested that there are three major implicit theories of how
          intelligence relates to society as a whole (Sternberg, 1997). These
          might be called Hamiltonian, Jeffersonian, and Jacksonian. These views
          are not based strictly, but rather, loosely, on the philosophies of
          Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and Andrew Jackson, three great
          statesmen in the history of the United States.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">G</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Hamiltonian view, which is similar to the Platonic view, is that
          people are born with different levels of intelligence and that those
          who are less intelligent need the good offices of the more intelligent
          to keep them in line, whether they are called government officials or,
          in Plato's term, philosopher-kings. Herrnstein and Murray (1994) seem
          to have shared this belief when they wrote about the emergence of a
          cognitive (high-IQ) elite, which eventually would have to take
          responsibility for the largely irresponsible masses of non-elite
          (low-IQ) people who cannot take care of themselves. Left to
          themselves, the unintelligent would create, as they always have
          created, a kind of chaos.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">H</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Jeffersonian view is that people should have equal opportunities,
          but they do not necessarily avail themselves equally of these
          opportunities and are not necessarily equally rewarded for their
          accomplishments. People are rewarded for what they accomplish, if
          given equal opportunity. Low achievers are not rewarded to the same
          extent as high achievers. In the Jeffersonian view, the goal of
          education is not to favor or foster an elite, as in the Hamiltonian
          tradition, but rather to allow children the opportunities to make full
          use of the skills they have. My own views are similar to these
          (Sternberg, 1997).
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">I</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Jacksonian view is that all people are equal, not only as human
          beings but in terms of their competencies – that one person would
          serve as well as another in government or on a jury or in almost any
          position of responsibility. In this view of democracy, people are
          essentially intersubstitutable except for specialized skills, all of
          which can be learned. In this view, we do not need or want any
          institutions that might lead to favoring one group over another.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">J</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Implicit theories of intelligence and of the relationship of
          intelligence to society perhaps need to be considered more carefully
          than they have been because they often serve as underlying
          presuppositions for explicit theories and even experimental designs
          that are then taken as scientific contributions. Until scholars are
          able to discuss their implicit theories and thus their assumptions,
          they are likely to miss the point of what others are saying when
          discussing their explicit theories and their data.

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Saving bugs to find new drugs</h3>

        <p className="italic mb-4">
          Zoologist Ross Piper looks at the potential of insects in
          pharmaceutical research
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          More drugs than you might think are derived from, or inspired by,
          compounds found in living things. Looking to nature for the soothing
          and curing of our ailments is nothing new – we have been doing it for
          tens of thousands of years. You only have to look at other primates –
          such as the capuchin monkeys who rub themselves with toxin-oozing
          millipedes to deter mosquitoes, or the chimpanzees who use noxious
          forest plants to rid themselves of intestinal parasites – to realise
          that our ancient ancestors too probably had a basic grasp of medicine.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Pharmaceutical science and chemistry built on these ancient
          foundations and perfected the extraction, characterization,
          modification and testing of these natural products. Then, for a while,
          modern pharmaceutical science moved its focus away from nature and
          into the laboratory, designing chemical compounds from scratch. The
          main cause of this shift is that although there are plenty of
          promising chemical compounds in nature, finding them is far from easy.
          Securing sufficient numbers of the organism in question, isolating and
          characterizing the compounds of interest, and producing large
          quantities of these compounds are all significant hurdles.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Laboratory-based drug discovery has achieved varying levels of
          success, something which has now prompted the development of new
          approaches focusing once again on natural products. With the ability
          to mine genomes for useful compounds, it is now evident that we have
          barely scratched the surface of nature's molecular diversity. This
          realization, together with several looming health crises, such as
          antibiotic resistance, has put bioprospecting – the search for useful
          compounds in nature – firmly back on the map.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Insects are the undisputed masters of the terrestrial domain, where
          the occupy every possible niche. Consequently, they have a bewildering
          array of interactions with other organisms, something which has driven
          the evolution of an enormous range of very interesting compounds for
          defensive and offensive purposes. Their remarkable diversity exceeds
          that of every other group of animals on the planet combined. Yet even
          though insects are far and away the most diverse animals in existence,
          their potential as sources of therapeutic compounds is yet to be
          realised.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          From the tiny proportion of insects that have been investigated,
          several promising compounds have been identified. For example,
          alloferon, an antimicrobial compound produced by blow fly larvae, is
          used as an antiviral and antitumor agent in South Korea and Russia.
          The larvae of a few other insect species are being investigated for
          the potent antimicrobial compounds they produce. Meanwhile, a compound
          from the venom of the wasp <em>Polybia paulista</em> has potential in
          cancer treatment.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Why is it that insects have received relatively little attention in
          bioprospecting? Firstly, there are so many insects that, without some
          manner of targeted approach, investigating this huge variety of
          species is a daunting task. Secondly, insects are generally very
          small, and the glands inside them that secrete potentially useful
          compounds are smaller still. This can make it difficult to obtain
          sufficient quantities of the compound for subsequent testing. Thirdly,
          although we consider insects to be everywhere, the reality of this
          ubiquity is vast numbers of a few extremely common species. Many
          insect species are infrequently encountered and very difficult to rear
          in captivity, which, again, can leave us with insufficient material to
          work with.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">G</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          My colleagues and I at Aberystwyth University in the UK have developed
          an approach in which we use our knowledge of ecology as a guide to
          target our efforts. The creatures that particularly interest us are
          the many insects that secrete powerful poison for subduing prey and
          keeping it fresh for future consumption. There are even more insects
          that are masters of exploiting filthy habitats, such as faeces and
          carcasses, where they are regularly challenged by thousands of
          micro-organisms. These insects have many antimicrobial compounds for
          dealing with pathogenic bacteria and fungi, suggesting that there is
          certainly potential to find many compounds that can serve as or
          inspire new antibiotics.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">H</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Although natural history knowledge points us in the right direction,
          it doesn't solve the problems associated with obtaining useful
          compounds from insects. Fortunately, it is now possible to snip out
          the stretches of the insect's DNA that carry the codes for the
          interesting compounds and insert them into cell lines that allow
          larger quantities to be produced. And although the road from isolating
          and characterizing compounds with desirable qualities to developing a
          commercial product is very long and full of pitfalls, the variety of
          successful animal-derived pharmaceuticals on the market demonstrates
          there is a precedent here that is worth exploring.

          With every bit of wilderness that disappears, we deprive ourselves of
          potential medicines. As much as I'd love to help develop a
          groundbreaking insect-derived medicine, my main motivation for looking
          at insects in this way is conservation. I sincerely believe that all
          species, however small and seemingly insignificant, have a right to
          exist for their own sake. If we can shine a light on the darker
          recesses of nature's medicine cabinet, exploring the useful chemistry
          of the most diverse animals on the planet, I believe we can make
          people think differently about the value of nature.

          You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27-40</strong>{" "}
          which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">The power of play</h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Virtually every child, the world over, plays. The drive to play is so
          intense that children will do so in any circumstances, for instance
          when they have no real toys, or when parents do not actively encourage
          the behavior. In the eyes of a young child, running, pretending, and
          building are fun. Researchers and educators know that these playful
          activities benefit the development of the whole child across social,
          cognitive, physical, and emotional domains. Indeed, play is such an
          instrumental component to healthy child development that the United
          Nation High Commission on Human Rights (1989) recognized play as a
          fundamental right of every child.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Yet, while experts continue to expound a powerful argument for the
          importance of play in children's lives, the actual time children spend
          playing continues to decrease. Today, children play eight hours less
          each week than their counterparts did two decades ago (Elkind 2008).
          Under pressure of rising academic standards, play is being replaced by
          test preparation in kindergartens and grade schools, and parents who
          aim to give their preschoolers a leg up are led to believe that
          flashcards and educational 'toys' are the path to success. Our society
          has created a false dichotomy between play and learning
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Through play, children learn to regulate their behavior, lay the
          foundations for later learning in science and mathematics, figure out
          the complex negotiations of social relationships, build a repertoire
          of creative problem-solving skills, and so much more. There is also an
          important role for adults in guiding children through playful learning
          opportunities.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Full consensus on a formal definition of play continues to elude the
          researchers and theorists who study it. Definitions range from
          discrete descriptions of various types of play such as physical,
          construction, language, or symbolic play (Miler & Almon 2009), to
          lists of broad criteria, based on observations and attitudes, that are
          meant to capture the essence of all play behaviors (e.g. Rubin et al.
          1983).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          A majority of the contemporary definitions of play focus on several
          key criteria. The founder of the National Institute for Play, Stuart
          Brown, has described play as 'anything that spontaneously is done for
          its own sake'. More specifically, he says it 'appears purposeless,
          produces pleasure and joy, [and] leads one to the next stage of
          mastery' (as quoted in Tippett 2008). Similarly, Miller and Almon
          (2009) say that play includes 'activities that are freely chosen and
          directed by children and arise from intrinsic motivation'. Often, play
          is defined along a continuum as more or less playful using the
          following set of behavioral and dispositional criteria (e.g. Rubin et
          al. 1983).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Play is pleasurable: Children must enjoy the activity or it is not
          play. It is intrinsically motivated: Children engage in play simply
          for the satisfaction the behavior itself brings. It has no
          extrinsically motivated function or goal. Play is process oriented:
          When children play, the means are more important than the ends. It is
          freely chosen, spontaneous and voluntary. If a child is pressured,
          they will likely not think of the activity as play. Play is actively
          engaged: Players must be physically and/or mentally involved in the
          activity. Play is non-literal. It involves make-believe.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          According to this view, children's playful behaviors can range in
          degree from 0% to 100% playful. Rubin and colleagues did not assign
          greater weight to any one dimension in determining playfulness;
          however, other researchers have suggested that process orientation and
          a lack of obvious functional purpose may be the most important aspects
          of play (e.g. Pellegrini 2009).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          From the perspective of a continuum, play can thus blend with other
          motives and attitudes that are less playful, such as work. Unlike
          play, work is typically not viewed as enjoyable and it is
          extrinsically motivated (i.e. it is goal oriented). Researcher Joan
          Goodman (1994) suggested that hybrid forms of work and play are not a
          detriment to learning; rather, they can provide optimal contexts for
          learning. For example, a child may be engaged in a difficult,
          goal-directed activity set up by their teacher, but they may still be
          actively engaged and intrinsically motivated. At this mid-point
          between play and work, the child's motivation, coupled with guidance
          from an adult, can create robust opportunities for playful learning.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Critically, recent research supports the idea that adults can
          facilitate children's learning while maintaining a playful approach in
          interactions known as 'guided play' (Fisher et al. 2011). The adult's
          role in play varies as a function of their educational goals and the
          child's developmental level (Hirsch-Pasek et al. 2009).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Guided play takes two forms. At a very basic level, adults can enrich
          the child's environment by providing objects or experiences that
          promote aspects of a curriculum. In the more direct form of guided
          play, parents or other adults can support children's play by joining
          in the fun as a co-player, raising thoughtful questions, commenting on
          children's discoveries, or encouraging further exploration or new
          facets to the child's activity. Although playful learning can be
          somewhat structured, it must also be child-centered (Nicolopolou et
          al. 2006). Play should stem from the child's own desire.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Both free and guided play are essential elements in a child-centered
          approach to playful learning. Intrinsically motivated free play
          provides the child with true autonomy, while guided play is an avenue
          through which parents and educators can provide more targeted learning
          experiences. In either case, play should be actively engaged, it
          should be predominantly child-directed, and it must be fun.
