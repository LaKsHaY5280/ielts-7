            Gobridge Tramlink – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Here are some of the frequently asked questions about the tram
            service in Gobridge town
          </p>

              <h4 className="font-bold mb-1">When do the trams run?</h4>
              <p>
                Gobridge Tramlink operates a network of trams that run
                throughout the year and provide links to main services, stations
                and the airport. Timetables are reviewed in October and March,
                and may alter slightly so check before you travel. Our first
                tram from the city centre leaves from Marvin Square at 6.30 am,
                half an hour after the first city bus service.

                Can I get a tram from the airport?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Trams from the airport to the city centre start running at 6.15
                am and leave every fifteen minutes until 7.30 pm when the
                evening schedule takes over. Trams then run to the main railway
                station at 35-minute intervals and end at 11.35 pm. If your
                flight arrives later than this, the number 207 airport bus runs
                every hour through the night.

                What do I do if I don't have a ticket?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Tickets are not sold by anyone on the tram. Ticket vending
                machines are located at all tram shelters. Check your route and
                make sure you buy the correct price ticket. If the vending
                machine does not work, you should push the red button on the
                machine and speak into the microphone. A member of staff will
                either fix the machine straight away or contact the tram
                inspector onboard your tram. He or she cannot sell you a ticket,
                but you will not be obliged to pay the £8 on-board fine for not
                having one.

                Can I take my bike on the tram?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Each tram is licensed to carry a maximum of two bicycles, though
                drivers may refuse to allow cyclists to get on if the tram is
                crowded. Bicycles may only be taken on the trams during off-peak
                travel periods: up to 7.30 am, between 10 am and 2.30 pm and
                after 7 pm. Festivals and other large events may also mean that
                bicycles are prohibited as trams carry extra passengers at these
                times. Once on board, riders should remain with their bicycles
                throughout the journey and ensure they do not obstruct the
                entrance, exit or any other area of public access.

                I spent a while thinking about buying this sweater because of
                the price, but I'm glad I finally did. It's a long sweater but
                that's good as I'm quite tall. I normally find that the sleeves
                are too short when I try on a top, but not with this one. I tend
                to take medium but went for large, which was a wise decision as
                there is plenty of room for a T-shirt underneath when I wear it
                with jeans.

              <p>
                These sweaters are an ideal weight for office wear. The purple
                one is pretty, though I expected a lighter shade from the
                picture. I wear a US size 12 / UK 16, and the medium is big
                enough to fit over a shirt with room to spare. It has long
                sleeves that I love to roll up at the wrist. I'm now trying to
                resist the temptation to buy it in grey too.

                This knitted sweater looks great in the pictures. I ordered the
                olive green with stripes and, although I wasn't sure it was
                going to look right on me, I was pleasantly surprised when I put
                it on. It's very soft and I love the long past-the-wrist sleeves
                too. I opted for the medium, but it was too tight so I exchanged
                it.

                This is the third of your sweaters that I've bought over the
                past two years. It's true to size and perfect for the winter
                months, though I should add that its loose knit means it's best
                to avoid playing with cats or young dogs when you're wearing it
                as they could pull threads in the body or sleeves.

                I couldn't decide which colour to get so I bought the deep blue
                and the charcoal grey, with every intention of sending one of
                them back. That didn't happen, of course! I would say both
                colours match the online pictures. I bought size small, and the
                length is perfect for me, despite the unnecessarily long
                sleeves! These sweaters are lovely to wear with jeans but also
                stylish enough to wear to work.

            How to Become a Great Leader
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Stepping into a new management role can be unnerving. Here's how to
            inspire your team:
          </p>

          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p>
              Set the tone of your leadership style from the outset. Be
              confident, self-assured, and respectful with everyone you meet.
              Speak as you want to be spoken to, and remember to listen. The
              first few weeks are when people develop their perceptions of you,
              so work hard to earn their trust. This will be key to effective
              change and progress.
            </p>

            <p>
              Part of a leader's brief is to set bold goals. They could take
              years to achieve, but they need to be specific enough that
              everyone in the organization understands them, buys into them, and
              is willing to work together to achieve them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Don't do everything yourself. Great leaders surround themselves
              with talented individuals and they should trust them to make
              things happen. If things need changing, tell people and involve
              them in making the changes by participating in the design of a new
              strategy. If the team is too cautious to embrace change, give them
              one more chance but be clearer about what you want.
            </p>

            <p>
              Stamp out the 'them and us' culture. In many organizations,
              employees feel distant from senior management. The message must be
              plain: we all work together, but leaders need to work hard to
              ensure this filters through to everyone in the organization.
            </p>

            <p>
              Allow time for innovation. It's important to give staff time to
              come up with new ideas and solutions that will fix new problems.
              However, be clear that a decision is expected; set a time limit
              and stick to it.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is likely that the formula that makes the business you are
              managing successful will have been created many years ago – but
              it's important to remember how the business started. Honour those
              early pioneers and instil a sense of pride across the
              organization.
            </p>

            <p>
              Leaders need to accept that some risk may be required if the
              situation calls for it. Playing it safe is never a good business
              rule, and leaders must make sure their business stays ahead by
              being prepared to act quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
              Show you are passionate and enthusiastic. People spend a large
              part of their lives working for an organization, and having a
              leader who is genuinely thrilled about its future is hugely
              inspiring.

            Resigning from a Job in a Professional Manner
          </h3>

          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p>
              When you take the decision to resign and move on to another job,
              you might really want to dance your way out of the door, or get
              your own back by criticising your boss to the whole office. But
              you need to resist these temptations because in future you might
              find you're working with your ex-line manager or other colleagues
              in a different company.
            </p>

            <div>
              <h4 className="font-bold mb-1">Letting your manager know</h4>
              <p>
                Show courtesy by telling your boss first. Request a meeting to
                say that you're leaving, following up soon after with an
                official letter. Before the meeting with your boss, write a list
                of ongoing tasks along with status updates and suggestions
                concerning completion. Use the meeting to clarify any other
                points, such as your notice period and leaving date, and how you
                will inform others (colleagues or external clients, contacts and
                suppliers). Ask about a reference too; your employer may only
                supply the most basic type but your line manager might also give
                you a more personal one. Making sure you get a good one can make
                subsequent job hunting less stressful.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4 className="font-bold mb-1">Preparation</h4>
              <p>
                Work out how you can ensure a smooth transition and minimise
                disruption to your employer. There may be a range of things you
                can do to hand over professionally, such as completing projects,
                working out the priorities with your line manager, and leaving
                clear documentation for the successor in your post concerning
                processes or software.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4 className="font-bold mb-1">Your letter of resignation</h4>
              <p>
                Keep your letter short. You don't need to give lots of
                explanations or justification for why you're leaving. Don't be
                tempted to address the failings of the company or your boss,
                either. Instead, thanking your employer for the job and
                mentioning what you appreciated about it is a graceful touch.
                Here's an idea of what to include:
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                <strong>First paragraph – the basics:</strong> Inform the
                employer that you wish to resign and confirm the agreed final
                date at work.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                <strong>Second paragraph – thank your employer:</strong> Mention
                any particular career-building projects you worked on or
                opportunities to develop skills and contribute to the employer's
                goals and successes. You can also mention your appreciation at
                being able to work in a great team.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                <strong>Third paragraph – handover:</strong> State your
                willingness to finish existing projects and hand over your work
                smoothly.
              </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Emojis</h3>

          <div className="space-y-4">

              <h4 className="font-bold">A</h4>
              <p>
                Language always changes, of course. This is one of the few
                constants about it. But it's arguably changing at a faster rate
                now than at any previous moment in its history. And emojis – the
                set of picture characters that people use to punctuate their
                online correspondence – are at the forefront of this frenzy for
                change.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a form of global communication, emojis only began their
                growth in 2011. Four years later, it was estimated that they
                were being used by over 90 per cent of the online population. In
                excess of six billion were being sent every day. Their
                prevalence in the culture was such that Oxford Dictionaries
                recently chose one as their word of the year. 'Words of the
                Year' are those judged to be reflective of the 'ethos, mood, or
                preoccupations of that particular year'. They're very much of
                their time. And often, once that time has passed, they fade from
                people's consciousness almost as quickly as they arose.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's a good chance, then, that the emoji chosen by Oxford
                Dictionaries – the 'face with tears of joy' – will also appear
                to be dated in a few years. But the reasons for this offer a
                fascinating insight into the way that society is evolving. The
                little yellow circle with dots for eyes acts as a surprisingly
                good lens through which to view the history of human
                communication, and to predict its future.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4 className="font-bold">B</h4>
              <p>
                There are two main reasons why language changes. One is to do
                with the way that language mirrors the changes in how we relate
                to each other. As an expression of identity, language is adapted
                by different groups and different generations to reflect their
                own sense of self. It also needs to constantly assimilate fresh
                concepts as these evolve.
              </p>
              <p>
                Words are being created for these reasons all the time. But
                what's interesting about emojis is that they've contributed to
                this ever-expanding storehouse in a different way. At this point
                in our history, the gaps in our vocabulary are being filled not
                simply by new words, but by an absolutely new system of
                expression.

                The second major reason that language changes is down to
                technology – specifically, the ways in which the technologies we
                use have an effect on the process of communication itself. Both
                hardware and new technologies result in us subtly changing the
                way we interact with each other and also altering the shape of
                the language we use.

                Emojis have evolved as a solution to the needs of mobile
                communication. In particular, they compensate for the way that
                computer-mediated messaging on smartphones can sometimes tend
                towards the emotionally empty. Whereas face-to-face, or even
                voice-to-voice, conversations can express emotional closeness
                through facial expression or tone of voice, this is easy to miss
                when messages are rendered in a few short words on a small
                screen. Emojis are a means of restoring this emotional framing
                to an interaction – punctuating your message with a smile.

                But unlike almost any other type of language system, emojis have
                something akin to a built-in obsolescence. Just as smartphones
                and their operating systems have a frequent refresh rate, emojis
                also get routine enhancements. The emojis you have on your phone
                now will undergo subtle redesigns over the course of time, and
                extra characters will be added. Because of this, their
                usefulness is artificially limited.

                In the context of communication systems, this is something
                that's never previously been the case. Twenty years ago, people
                might have bought a new landline phone when they were tired of
                the design of their old phone or if they wanted to get one with
                whatever latest innovation was going around – an inbuilt
                answering machine, say. But they didn't have to upgrade the
                language they were using as well.

                Emojis, on the other hand, are a case study of how technology
                and the human capacity for communication are working together –
                of how the onward march of technology exists at the intersection
                of consumerism, innovation and design. Moreover, the fact that
                they're at the front line of a relentless wave of
                technologically driven change in communications practices
                encourages – if not necessitates – a great amount of creativity
                in the way they're used.

              <p>
                Finally, there's the way they've become implicated in almost all
                aspects of modern society, from politics and marketing to art
                and entertainment. Emojis are the subject of musicals and
                Hollywood films. They're the inspiration for fashion design, art
                and architecture. They're a staple in advertising and commerce.
                Understanding why they've become so popular, and how they work,
                can not only explain something about the nature of language; it
                can also help us to understand our relationship with technology,
                society and ourselves.
