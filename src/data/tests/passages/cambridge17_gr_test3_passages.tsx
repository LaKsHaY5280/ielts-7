        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Local countryside walks</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The following walks have coloured marker posts to guide you
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A Grove Mill</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Take either the yellow path or the blue path — both eventually come
          out at the Old Water Mill and are at about the same level of
          difficulty. There is a shallow stream which runs alongside the yellow
          path. Dogs enjoy a swim here if it's hot, and there are trees to help
          keep you cool while you wait.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B Blackhill Trail</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Follow the marker posts carefully as you make your way through some
          dense forest. If you take a wrong turn, as walkers often do, your walk
          could end up being a lot longer than you expected. The sun may be
          shining, but there is plenty of damp undergrowth, so wear a tough pair
          of hiking boots if you don't want your feet to get wet. It isn't
          advisable to take small dogs on this trail.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C Fern Way</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The route is winding but fairly flat and doesn't require any special
          footwear or equipment. It is accessed by a gate with a strong bolt to
          keep sheep and cows in the field. The path is lined on both sides by
          firs and some majestic redwoods that date back to the nineteenth
          century. There are benches along the way, where you can rest and
          admire the beauty of the area.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D Bay Red Valley</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Be prepared to go up and down a bit on this route. The first section
          is uphill, then the path flattens out — but not for long, so you need
          to be fairly fit. The exercise is worth it, though, as there are some
          spectacular views across the valley. There is a viewing platform, from
          which you may be lucky enough to see one of the herds of deer that
          roam the area.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E Brownwater Trail</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          A circular path will take you past tree and plant species from around
          the world that are cared for by a dedicated team of volunteers. If you
          bring your dog, keep it on a lead as the smaller shrubs can be easily
          destroyed. The path itself is open and unprotected, so be sure to wear
          a hat or you could get sunburnt.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Poppi Properties</h3>
        <p className="mb-2 italic">Review by Sally Hanugoldi</p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          I have had a terrible experience with Poppi Properties and as an
          ex-tenant, I advise you to go elsewhere if you want to rent or buy a
          property — as I have now done. When I initially viewed my Poppi
          Properties flat, I was accompanied by Lillee Eggerton, one of the two
          staff who run the company. The flat was located close to the office
          where I have been working for the past year, so I went there before
          the working day had begun. I knew immediately that it was the right
          property for me because of the convenient location, and a few days
          later I paid the deposit and the first two months' rent. The flat was
          on the 12th floor, which I admit was a surprise to me as I thought it
          was lower when I first read about it, but Lillee was very encouraging,
          and I felt confident that I was making the right choice. At this
          point, she was professional and kind, but once I had moved into the
          property, I discovered that she was far less approachable than she had
          been during the viewing period and whenever I tried to contact her,
          she was unavailable.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          At the start of my tenancy, a number of issues were unsatisfactory in
          the property. For example, as a new tenant, you have a right to expect
          your flat to be clean. In fact, carpets should be professionally
          cleaned, but mine had not even been hoovered. I had hoped that this
          problem would be addressed quickly, but nothing happened and so I did
          the job myself. Similarly, the oven worked when I switched it on, but
          it was black inside and smelt horrible. The company did nothing, so in
          the end I just avoided using the oven while I lived there. Several
          times, I asked to speak to the landlord directly but was told this was
          not possible. No one should have to put up with these problems,
          particularly when Poppi Properties charge such high rents!

          Procedure for making a complaint at work
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          If you have a problem or complaint at work, you might want to take
          this up with your employer. This is called 'raising a grievance'.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Often the best way to sort out a problem is to request an informal
          meeting with your immediate manager to explain your concerns. You may
          find it is possible to sort the problem out in this way without having
          to take any further action. However, if you do not feel your problem
          has been solved, you may decide to raise a formal grievance. In this
          case you should first try to find out your company's grievance
          procedure. You should be able to find details of this in your Company
          Handbook, HR or Personnel manual, or on your company's HR intranet
          site.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          The next step will probably be to write to your employer. Explain your
          problem, and if you can think of a possible solution for resolving it,
          give details of this. When you have written your letter, check that
          you have written the date, and retain a copy so that you have a record
          of what you wrote. Your employer should arrange an initial meeting at
          a reasonable time and place to discuss your grievance. You are
          entitled to ask either a colleague from work or a trade union
          representative to go to the meeting with you. After the meeting, your
          employer should write to you, telling you what they have decided to do
          about your grievance.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          If you don't agree with your employer's decision, you have the right
          to appeal against it. This must be done in writing. A further meeting
          should then be called, which should be led by a more senior manager if
          possible. If you are still not satisfied with the decision made at
          this meeting, you may consider whether one way to solve the problem
          might be through mediation. This may be done inside the company or by
          an external agent. Alternatively, you can make an employment tribunal
          claim. You must do this no more than three months after the time when
          the event you are complaining about happened. If your application is
          received after this time limit, the tribunal will not usually accept
          it.

          Driving a taxi or private hire vehicle
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Taxis are an important part of any town or city's transport system.
          Taxis have a licence plate and roof sign that states they are a taxi.
          As a taxi driver you might be booked in advance, wait on a taxi rank
          or pick up passengers while on the move. You could combine normal
          'pick-up' jobs with prearranged contracts such as regular trips for
          schoolchildren or those unable to drive. You might also make
          longer-distance trips such as taking people to airports. The other
          type of passenger transport is a private hire vehicle. As a private
          hire driver, you can only collect passengers who have pre-booked
          through your operator. You cannot be flagged down in the street.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          When working in a taxi or private hire vehicle, you would:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            take job details over the radio from the operator at the office or
            by an in-car computer
          </li>
          <li>help to load and unload passengers' luggage</li>
          <li>
            assist passengers with any physical conditions that make it
            difficult for them to get in and out of the vehicle
          </li>
          <li>take payments</li>
          <li>keep the vehicle clean and roadworthy</li>
          <li>keep accounts and records, if self-employed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Working conditions and skills</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          You would spend most of your time on the road, sometimes in heavy
          traffic, and you would be constantly on the move. The job allows you
          to choose your hours, but you will find more work in the evenings. You
          would work between 40 and 60 hours a week if full time. In the UK, 17%
          of taxi drivers are employed full time, 17% are employed part time and
          66% are self-employed. As well as being a skilled driver, you need to
          be good at communicating with people and helping customers. You must
          be tactful when dealing with problems and have good time management
          and numeracy skills.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Requirements</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          You will need a special licence from your local authority to be a taxi
          driver or private car hire driver. For this, you usually need to be
          over 21 years old, to have a clean current driving licence and to have
          been driving for at least 12 months. You may also need to pass a test
          of knowledge about the local geography. If you are using your own
          vehicle, it will also need a special licence. Many employers value
          additional driver training which could include the Advanced Driving
          Test offered by the Institute of Advanced Motorists. Evidence of basic
          mechanical skills, such as RQF level 4, would also be welcome.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Forced rhubarb</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify italic">
          Rhubarb has large fan-shaped leaves and long, green edible stalks,
          which are commonly cooked with sugar to make pies and other desserts.
          One type of rhubarb is grown in the dark to produce longer, rosier
          stalks and this is called 'forced rhubarb'.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">A</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          In the north of England, a cold winter is good news for some, and not
          just snowmen and woolly hat makers. According to Yorkshire farmer
          David Westwood, this year's forced rhubarb is the best for years.
          Westwood, a softly spoken Yorkshireman, should know. He's been growing
          and selling rhubarb for 62 years, since he started picking on the farm
          aged 11. His son Jonathan works on the farm too, making him the sixth
          generation of the Westwoods to grow the pink stems or 'petioles' as
          they are otherwise known.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">B</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          We meet at his farm, a few miles from the city of Wakefield, which
          with the cities of Bradford and Leeds form the three points of the
          Rhubarb Triangle, the heart of the British rhubarb industry. 'It
          doesn't grow as well anywhere else,' insists Westwood. He has a number
          of theories as to why this is. The loam soil on a clay base is perfect
          for the roots or "crowns" which rhubarb grows from. In Victorian times
          — the mid-to-late 1800s – when rhubarb's popularity was at its peak,
          the local coal mines provided cheap fuel for heating the sheds, a
          crucial part of the forcing process, which involves depriving the
          plants of light as they develop. At the same time, the effluence from
          the industry enriched the soil for farmers. On top of that, according
          to Westwood, the high levels of pollution in the air would have been
          ideal for the rhubarb, as 'rhubarb loves soot'.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">C</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Westwood's farm produces both the greenish outdoor rhubarb, the kind
          that grows well in gardens all over the country, and the startlingly
          pink forced rhubarb. It's this that is the 'cream of the crop', the
          upper class of the rhubarb family. Forced rhubarb is the one that's
          most likely to convert rhubarb-haters who've been traumatized by
          harshly flavoured school pies made from green overgrown outdoor stems.
          The slender magenta spears, with a sherbet-tangy flavour and delicate
          texture, are a far cry from that coarse, bitter stuff. It's also a
          rare local fruit (although technically a vegetable) at a time when
          imports dominate, and a welcome splash of colour in the drab winter
          months. No wonder chefs and food writers have fallen in love with
          forced rhubarb all over again. It's enjoying a remarkable renaissance,
          for only 20 years ago it was in such decline that Westwood, one of the
          last 12 growers left from a peak of 200, was considering abandoning
          it.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">D</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          There are certainly simpler ways to grow food. First the plant roots,
          or crowns, are grown outside for more than two years. Then, at the
          start of their third winter, they are left in the ground until it is
          cold enough to break the crowns' dormancy. This is one of the factors
          that gives British rhubarb the edge over imports from the Netherlands,
          which arrive in the country a scene-stealing couple of weeks before
          the Yorkshire crop. To bring them to market that early, the Dutch
          crowns are fed with gibberellic acid, to replace the hormones
          naturally generated by a period of cold weather. Westwood is relaxed
          on the subject of the imported rhubarb, remarking only: 'It's
          good-looking all right, but the flavour's nowhere near.' Back in
          Yorkshire, sometime around the middle of November, the crowns are dug
          up, transferred to sheds with earthen floors, and watered in. The
          light is blocked out completely and the heating is turned on. In the
          warm and dark, the shoots appear so quickly that the buds can be heard
          gently popping. Within three weeks or so, the first round of picking,
          or 'pulling' as it's known, can begin.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">E</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          In Westwood's 1920s rhubarb sheds, it is pitch black. I slip and slide
          on the narrow troughs that serve as paths between the beds of rhubarb
          crowns. It's a relief when a team of 'pullers' arrive, all local men,
          some of whom have been working for Westwood for 40 years. Each carries
          a sturdy candle, and their pale, flickering light reveals a sea of
          yellow leaves stretching 40 metres to the far wall. The men walk the
          beds plucking the satiny stems expertly, choosing only the ones that
          have reached the length of an arm. Then, cradling the fuchsia pink
          bundles in their arms, they move on to the next patch. It's an
          extraordinary sight in this age of mechanised, computerised
          agriculture. 'The pulling's done much the same way as it always has
          been,' Westwood says. 'Electric light spoils the colour.' A
          labour-intensive process, it goes some way to explain the admittedly
          eye-watering price of the best forced rhubarb – that and the heating,
          now from oil or propane rather than coal.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">F</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          So how was this arcane cold-dark-heat process, in use since Victorian
          times, discovered? Westwood's story is appealingly earthy. A gardener
          threw an old crown onto the horse stable muck pile. The manure was
          hot, and the plant was soon covered. The stable boy must have been
          puzzled by the startling pink spears that came pushing through the
          dirt a week or two later, but happily he had the good sense to gather
          them. Where there's muck there's money – and good eating indeed.
