        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Bats to the rescue</h3>
        <p className="italic mb-4">
          How Madagascar's bats are helping to save the rainforest
        </p>

        <div className="space-y-4 text-justify">
          <p>
            There are few places in the world where relations between
            agriculture and conservation are more strained. Madagascar's forests
            are being converted to agricultural land at a rate of one percent
            every year. Much of this destruction is fuelled by the cultivation
            of the country's main staple crop: rice. And a key reason for this
            destruction is that insect pests are destroying vast quantities of
            what is grown by local subsistence farmers, leading them to clear
            forest to create new paddy fields. The result is devastating habitat
            and biodiversity loss on the island, but not all species are
            suffering. In fact, some of the island's insectivorous bats are
            currently thriving and this has important implications for farmers
            and conservationists alike.
          </p>

          <p>
            Enter University of Cambridge zoologist Ricardo Rocha. He's
            passionate about conservation, and bats. More specifically, he's
            interested in how bats are responding to human activity and
            deforestation in particular. Rocha's new study shows that several
            species of bats are giving Madagascar's rice farmers a vital pest
            control service by feasting on plagues of insects. And this, he
            believes, can ease the financial pressure on farmers to turn forest
            into fields.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bats comprise roughly one-fifth of all mammal species in Madagascar
            and thirty-six recorded bat species are native to the island, making
            it one of the most important regions for conservation of this animal
            group anywhere in the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Co-leading an international team of scientists, Rocha found that
            several species of indigenous bats are taking advantage of habitat
            modification to hunt insects swarming above the country's rice
            fields. They include the Malagasy mouse-eared bat, Major's
            long-fingered bat, the Malagasy white-bellied free-tailed bat and
            Peters' wrinkle-lipped bat.
          </p>

          <p>
            'These winner species are providing a valuable free service to
            Madagascar as biological pest suppressors,' says Rocha. 'We found
            that six species of bat are preying on rice pests, including the
            paddy swarming caterpillar and grass webworm. The damage which these
            insects cause puts the island's farmers under huge financial
            pressure and that encourages deforestation.'
          </p>

          <p>
            The study, now published in the journal{" "}
            <em>Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment</em>, set out to
            investigate the feeding activity of insectivorous bats in the
            farmland bordering the Ranomafana National Park in the southeast of
            the country.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rocha and his team used state-of-the-art ultrasonic recorders to
            record over a thousand bat 'feeling buzzes' (echolocation sequences
            used by bats to target their prey) at 54 sites, in order to identify
            the favourite feeding spots of the bats. The next used DNA barcoding
            techniques to analyse droppings collected from bats at the different
            sites.
          </p>

          <p>
            The recordings revealed that bat activity over rice fields was much
            higher than it was in continuous forest – seven times higher over
            rice fields which were on flat ground, and sixteen times higher over
            fields on the sides of hills – leaving no doubt that the animals are
            preferentially foraging in these man-made ecosystems. The
            researchers suggest that the bats favour these fields because lack
            of water and nutrient run-off make these crops more susceptible to
            insect pest infestations. DNA analysis showed that all six species
            of bat had fed on economically important insect pests. While the
            findings indicated that rice farming benefits most from the bats,
            the scientists also found indications that the bats were consuming
            pests of other crops, including the black twig borer (which infests
            coffee plants), the sugarcane cicada, the macadamia nut-borer, and
            the sober tabby (a pest of citrus fruits).
          </p>

          <p>
            'The effectiveness of bats as pest controllers has already been
            proven in the USA and Catalonia,' said co-author James Kemp, from
            the University of Lisbon. 'But our study is the first to show this
            happening in Madagascar, where the stakes for both farmers and
            conservationists are so high.'
          </p>

          <p>
            Local people may have a further reason to be grateful to their bats.
            While the animal is often associated with spreading disease, Rocha
            and his team found evidence that Malagasy bats feed not just on crop
            pests but also on mosquitoes – carriers of malaria, Rift Valley
            fever virus and elephantiasis – as well as blackflies, which spread
            river blindness.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rocha points out that the relationship is complicated. When food is
            scarce, bats become a crucial source of protein for local people.
            Even the children will hunt them. And as well as roosting in trees,
            the bats sometimes roost in buildings, but are not welcomed there
            because they make them unclean. At the same time, however, they are
            associated with sacred caves and the ancestors, so they can be
            viewed as beings between worlds, which makes them very significant
            in the culture of the people. And one potential problem is that
            while these bats are benefiting from farming, at the same time
            deforestation is reducing the places where they can roost, which
            could have long-term effects on their numbers. Rocha says, 'With the
            right help, we hope that farmers can promote this mutually
            beneficial relationship by installing bat houses.'
          </p>

          <p>
            Rocha and his colleagues believe that maximising bat populations can
            help to boost crop yields and promote sustainable livelihoods. The
            team is now calling for further research to quantify this
            contribution. 'I'm very optimistic,' says Rocha. 'If we give nature
            a hand, we can speed up the process of regeneration.'

          Does education fuel economic growth?
        </h3>

        <div className="space-y-4 text-justify">
          <p className="font-bold">A</p>
          <p>
            Over the last decade, a huge database about the lives of southwest
            German villagers between 1600 and 1900 has been compiled by a team
            led by Professor Sheilagh Ogilvie at Cambridge University's Faculty
            of Economics. It includes court records, guild ledgers, parish
            registers, village censuses, tax lists and – the most recent
            addition – 9,000 handwritten inventories listing over a million
            personal possessions belonging to ordinary women and men across
            three centuries. Ogilvie, who discovered the inventories in the
            archives of two German communities 30 years ago, believes they may
            hold the answer to a conundrum that has long puzzled economists: the
            lack of evidence for a causal link between education and a country's
            economic growth.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold">B</p>
          <p>
            As Ogilvie explains, 'Education helps us to work more productively,
            invent better technology, and earn more … surely it must be critical
            for economic growth? But, if you look back through history, there's
            no evidence that having a high literacy rate made a country
            industrialise earlier.' Between 1600 and 1900, England had only
            mediocre literacy rates by European standards, yet its economy grew
            fast and it was the first country to industrialise. During this
            period, Germany and Scandinavia had excellent literacy rates, but
            their economies grew slowly and they industrialised late. 'Modern
            cross-country analyses have also struggled to find evidence that
            education causes economic growth, even though there is plenty of
            evidence that growth increases education,' she adds.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold">C</p>
          <p>
            In the handwritten inventories that Ogilvie is analysing are the
            belongings of women and men at marriage, remarriage and death. From
            badger skins to Bibles, sewing machines to scarlet bodices – the
            villagers' entire worldly goods are included. Inventories of
            agricultural equipment and craft tools reveal economic activities;
            ownership of books and education-related objects like pens and
            slates suggests how people learned. In addition, the tax lists
            included in the database record the value of farms, workshops,
            assets and debts; signatures and people's estimates of their age
            indicate literacy and numeracy levels; and court records reveal
            obstacles (such as the activities of the guilds*) that stifled
            industry.
          </p>

          <p>
            Previous studies usually had just one way of linking education with
            economic growth – the presence of schools and printing presses,
            perhaps, or school enrolment, or the ability to sign names.
            According to Ogilvie, the database provides multiple indicators for
            the same individuals, making it possible to analyse links between
            literacy, numeracy, wealth, and industriousness, for individual
            women and men over the long term.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold">D</p>
          <p>
            Ogilvie and her team have been building the vast database of
            material possessions on top of their full demographic reconstruction
            of the people who lived in these two German communities. 'We can
            follow the same people – and their descendants – across 300 years of
            educational and economic change,' she says. Individual lives have
            unfolded before their eyes. Stories like that of the 24-year-olds
            Ana Regina and Magdalena Riethmüllerin, who were chastised in 1707
            for reading books in church instead of listening to the sermon.
            'This tells us they were continuing to develop their reading skills
            at least a decade after leaving school,' explains Ogilvie. The
            database also reveals the case of Juliana Schweickherdt, a
            50-year-old spinster living in the small Black Forest community of
            Wildberg, who was reprimanded in 1752 by the local weavers' guild
            for 'weaving cloth and combing wool, counter to the guide
            ordinance'. When Juliana continued taking jobs reserved for male
            guild members, she was summoned before the guild court and told to
            pay a fine equivalent to one third of a servant's annual wage. It
            was a small act of defiance by today's standards, but it reflects a
            time when laws in Germany and elsewhere regulated people's access to
            labour markets. The dominance of guilds not only prevented people
            from using their skills, but also held back even the simplest
            industrial innovation.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold">E</p>
          <p>
            The data-gathering phase of the project has been completed and now,
            according to Ogilvie, it is time 'to ask the big questions'. One way
            to look at whether education causes economic growth is to 'hold
            wealth constant'. This involves following the lives of different
            people with the same level of wealth over a period of time. If
            wealth is constant, it is possible to discover whether education
            was, for example, linked to the cultivation of new crops, or to the
            adoption of industrial innovations like sewing machines. The team
            will also ask what aspect of education helped people engage more
            with productive and innovative activities. Was it, for instance,
            literacy, numeracy, book ownership, years of schooling? Was there a
            threshold level – a tipping point – that needed to be reached to
            affect economic performance?
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold">F</p>
          <p>
            Ogilvie hopes to start finding answers to these questions over the
            next few years. One thing is already clear, she says: the
            relationship between education and economic growth is far from
            straightforward. 'German-speaking central Europe is an excellent
            laboratory for testing theories of economic growth,' she explains.
            Between 1600 and 1900, literacy rates and book ownership were high
            and yet the region remained poor. It was also the case that local
            guilds and merchant associations were extremely powerful and
            legislated against anything that undermined their monopolies. In
            villages throughout the region, guilds blocked labour migration and
            resisted changes that might reduce their influence.
          </p>

          <p>
            'Early findings suggest that the potential benefits of education for
            the economy can be held back by other barriers, and this has
            implications for today,' says Ogilvie. 'Huge amounts are spent
            improving education in developing countries, but this spending can
            fail to deliver economic growth if restrictions block people –
            especially women and the poor – from using their education in
            economically productive ways. If economic institutions are poorly
            set up, for instance, education can't lead to growth.'

          Timur Gareyev – blindfold chess champion
        </h3>

        <div className="space-y-4 text-justify">
          <p className="font-bold">A</p>
          <p>
            Next month, a chess player named Timur Gareyev will take on nearly
            50 opponents at once. But that is not the hard part. While his
            challengers will play the games as normal, Gareyev himself will be
            blindfolded. Even by world record standards, it sets a high bar for
            human performance. The 28-year-old already stands out in the
            rarefied world of blindfold chess. He has a fondness for bright
            clothes and unusual hairstyles, and he gets his kicks from the
            adventure sport of BASE jumping. He has already proved himself a
            strong chess player, too. In a 10-hour chess marathon in 2013,
            Gareyev played 33 games in his head simultaneously. He won 29 and
            lost none. The skill has become his brand: he calls himself the
            Blindfold King.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold">B</p>
          <p>
            But Gareyev's prowess has drawn interest from beyond the
            chess-playing community. In the hope of understanding how he and
            others like him can perform such mental feats, researchers at the
            University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA) called him in for
            tests. They now have their first results. 'The ability to play a
            game of chess with your eyes closed is not a far reach for most
            accomplished player,' said Jesse Rissman, who runs a memory lab at
            UCLA. 'But the thing that's so remarkable about Timur and a few
            other individuals is the number of games they can keep active at
            once. To me it is simply astonishing.'
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold">C</p>
          <p>
            Gareyev learned to play chess in his native Uzbekistan when he was
            six years old. Tutored by his grandfather, he entered his first
            tournament aged eight and soon became obsessed with competitions. At
            16, he was crowned Asia's youngest ever chess grandmaster. He moved
            to the US soon after, and as a student helped his university win its
            first national chess championship. In 2013, Gareyev was ranked the
            third best chess player in the US.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold">D</p>
          <p>
            To the uninitiated, blindfold chess seems to call for superhuman
            skill. But displays of the feat go back centuries. The first
            recorded game in Europe was played in 13th-century Florence. In
            1947, the Argentinian grandmaster Miguel Najdorf played 45
            simultaneous games in his mind, winning 39 in the 24-hour session.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold">E</p>
          <p>
            Accomplished players can develop the skill of playing blind even
            without realising it. The nature of the game is to run through
            possible moves in the mind to see how they play out. From this,
            regular players develop a memory for the patterns the pieces make,
            the defences and attacks. 'You recreate it in your mind,' said
            Gareyev. 'A lot of players are capable of doing what I'm doing.' The
            real mental challenge comes from playing multiple games at once in
            the head. Not only must the positions of each piece on every board
            be memorised, they must be recalled faithfully when needed, updated
            with each player's moves, and then reliably stored again, so the
            brain can move on to the next board. First moves can be tough to
            remember because they are fairly uninteresting. But the ends of
            games are taxing too, as exhaustion sets in. When Gareyev is tired,
            his recall can get patchy. He sometimes makes moves based on only a
            fragmented memory of the pieces' positions.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold">F</p>
          <p>
            The scientists first had Gareyev perform some standard memory tests.
            These assessed his ability to hold numbers, pictures and words in
            mind. One classic test measures how many numbers a person can
            repeat, both forwards and backwards, soon after hearing them. Most
            people manage about seven. 'He was not exceptional on any of these
            standard tests,' said Rissman. 'We didn't find anything other than
            playing chess that he seems to be supremely gifted at.' But next
            came the brain scans. With Gareyev lying down in the machine,
            Rissman looked at how well connected the various regions of the
            chess player's brain were. Though the results are tentative and as
            yet unpublished, the scans found much greater than average
            communication between parts of Gareyev's brain that make up what is
            called the frontoparietal control network. Of 63 people scanned
            alongside the chess player, only one or two scored more highly on
            the measure. 'You use this network in almost any complex task. It
            helps you to allocate attention, keep rules in mind, and work out
            whether you should be responding or not,' said Rissman.

            It was not the only hint of something special in Gareyev's brain.
            The scans also suggest that Gareyev's visual network is more highly
            connected to other brain parts than usual. Initial results suggest
            that the areas of his brain that process visual images – such as
            chess boards – may have stronger links to other brain regions, and
            so be more powerful than normal. While the analyses are not
            finalised yet, they may hold the first clues to Gareyev's
            extraordinary ability.

            For the world record attempt, Gareyev hopes to play 47 blindfold
            games at once in about 16 hours. He will need to win 80% to claim
            the title. 'I don't worry too much about the winning percentage,
            that's never been an issue for me,' he said. 'The most important
            part of blindfold chess for me is that I have found the one thing
            that I can fully dedicate myself to. I miss having an obsession.'
